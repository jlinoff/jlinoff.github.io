<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em>myVault</em> is single page web app, available at <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault</a>, that allows you to securely manage your personal data as searchable records in a secure, flexible manner. Each record contains arbitrary data that you care about, such as the password for a site or the last book you read with notes. You define the record format and contents. Each record can be different. Both the format and the content of each record can be changed at anytime.</p>
<p><em>myVault</em> allows you to control where the data is stored. The web app is self contained so data is never shipped to external web site. I tend to save my data in a file in a common place (like Google Drive and iCloud) so that all my devices can access it. If you store your data on a local drive make sure that it is backed up regularly.</p>
<p>The record data is protected by a master password. It is used to encrypt all data that is exported and decrypt all data that is imported. For more information see the <a href="#master-password">Master Password</a> section.</p>
<p>Each record is composed of fields. A field has a name and a value. One key feature of the program is that the field types changes based on the field name. Thus, if a field name contains the word <code>"password"</code> or <code>"secret"</code>, the value changes to a password input which hides the value. If the field name contains the word <code>"notes"</code>, the value field changes to a multi-line text box to allow you enter multiple lines of text. All other fields like <code>"name"</code> or <code>"url"</code> are treated as simple strings. Although the webapp does to try to identify <em>URLs</em> and present them as links in view mode.</p>
<p><em>myVault</em> is very customizable. You can change the page title, the encryption algorithm used, the page theme colors, the page theme properties like font size, templates that define the fields used in records, the mapping between field names and their types, and more. The customization is done on the preferences page. Each customization panel has some information about what it does.</p>
<p><em>myVault</em> also provides built-in password generation for both cryptic and memorable passwords for all password fields, including the master password. See the <a href="#master-password">Master Password</a> for details on cryptic and memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The app also provides built in example data to allow you to play with the capabilities without committing to anything. It is a great way to get familiar with the program and is also really useful during development.</p>
<p>I use <em>myVault</em> to store my password information and keep track of books that i have read. The books don’t really need to be secure. I simply use it because it is convenient to use on my mobile devices.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>This section describes the layout of the app and talks about each section in detail.</p>
<p>All sections use accordion panels to display options. Opening the panel provides more information about what it does. There are icons at the top of the accordion panels that allow you to expand or collapse all of the panels at once.</p>
<h3 id="menu">Menu</h3>
<p>It all starts with the menu. Which is an icon positioned in the upper right corner of the app window. There 5 menu options for selecting one of the five different pages. The pages are briefly described in the table below and more thoroughly described in subsequent sections.</p>

<h3 id="records-page">Records Page</h3>
<p>Work with the records. You can add, change or delete records. The top level records page shows all of the records in accordion panels. You can click on a record accordion panel to see the record details.</p>
<h4 id="search">Search</h4>
<p>There is search bar at the top that allows you search for records that match a pattern. The search searches all of the record titles in a case insensitive manner. The default is to search for <em>all</em> records. The search syntax is the Javascript RegEx syntax.</p>
<p>The records list is updated as you type.</p>
<h4 id="add-new-record">Add New Record</h4>
<p>Underneath the search bar there are three buttons: a button to expand all of the accordion panels, a button to collapse the all of the accordion panels and a <q>+</q> button to add a new record. There is also a count of the number of records which match the search criteria.</p>
<p>When you click on the add new record button a new sub-page appears.</p>
<p>Enter the data for the fields that you want to add and click on the <q>Create</q> button to create the new record.</p>
<p>Before entering any field information you can choose a record field template from the <q>Template</q> selection box if you want to use pre-defined fields. This is helpful if you want a common format for the records. Note that you can define your own templates in the <q>Preferences</q>.</p>
<p>Click the <q>Discard</q> button to discard the changes and go back to the main records page.</p>
<p>The <q>Add Field</q> button allows you to append a new field which is a new row at the end with name and a value.</p>
<p>A field will not be included in a record if either the name or the value are empty.</p>
<p>Certain field names will change the value type. For example a field named <q>password</q> will create a password input. There are three value types: string (basic input), textarea (multi-line input) and password (a password field). The field type will change <em>as you type the name</em>. Thus the name <q>passwor</q> (missing the final <q>d</q>) will be string field but when you type the final <q>d</q>, the value field will change to a password. You can define the mapping between field names and field values in the <q>Preferences</q> in the <q>Record Field Name Based Types</q> accordion entry.</p>
<h4 id="view-record">View Record</h4>
<p>When a record is expanded you will see a view of its contents. Urls will be seen as links (the program figure that out automatically), passwords will not be displayed (you can see them by clicking on the eye icon). All fields can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the copy icon on the far right.</p>
<h4 id="delete-record">Delete Record</h4>
<p>A record can be deleted by clicking on the trashcan icon in view mode. See the <q>how to</q> entries in subsequent sections for details.</p>
<h4 id="edit-record">Edit Record</h4>
<p>A record can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon. See the <q>how to</q> entries in subsequent sections for details.</p>
<h3 id="save-page">Save Page</h3>
<p>This page contains the options available for saving data. They are briefly summarized in the table below.</p>

</table>
<h2 id="master-password">Master Password</h2>
<p>The record data is protected by a master password. It is used to encrypt all data that is exported and decrypt all data that is imported so the only data ever saved is secure which means that the encrypted data in the stored file looks something like this.</p>
<pre><code>----------------------- crypt-aes-256-gcm prefix -----------------------

----------------------- crypt-aes-256-gcm suffix -----------------------</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it is not of much use without the password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your master password is lost, the data cannot be recovered because the program never stores it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The encryption algorithm is AES-256 which is considered quite secure and should be relatively safe from future quantum attacks. Furthermore, the encryption algorithm runs <em>inside</em> the browser so, as mentioned earlier, your data is never shipped to an external server.</p>
<p>I recommend creating a memorable password (<a href="#memorable">Memorable</a> below) because this is the <em>only</em> password that you have to remember to access all of your password records. It may even make sense to write it down and store it in a secure place.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-password-generation">Automatic Password Generation</h2>
<p>lll passwords (including the master password) have four extra buttona: an eye button to let you view the password as plaintext, a single gear button that generates a <em>cryptic</em> password, a multiple gear button that generates a <em>memorable</em> password and a copy button that copies the password to the clipboard that can be pasted externally.</p>
<h3 id="cryptic">Cryptic</h3>
<p>Cryptic passwords are secure, hard to remember passwords that are a pseudo random collection of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters. Here are two examples of cryptic passwords: <q><code>t0t5Q2eL!6E7!s6nWp6lv1</code></q> and <q><code>SiPeD_dLQa03NIG</code></q>.</p>
<h3 id="memorable">Memorable</h3>
<p>Memorable passwords are secure, easy to remember passwords that are composed of three pseudo randomly chosen english words separated by a slash. Here are two examples of memorable passwords: <q><code>farming/naval/decision</code></q> and <q><code>viewed/frequencies/looking</code></q>.</p>
<h3 id="custom">Custom</h3>
<p>The cryptic and memorable buttons make it easy to generate passwords automatically but if you prefer another style you can always enter your passwords manually.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p><em>myVault</em>, like all webapps or programs, has security challenges. By understanding them you can better protect your record data.</p>
<h3 id="mitm">MITM</h3>
<p>Unlike many other webapps, it does <em>not</em> talk to an internet based web server which means that the data is never transported from your computer over the internet. Because no data is ever transmitted, it is protected from monster-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-web-site-security">Third Party Web Site Security</h3>
<p>Furthermore, because it does not send the data to a server, it is not vulnerable to how cybersecurity is managed on the server by a third party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can verify that <em>myVault</em> is not sending data out by monitoring outbound traffic from your system. This web app never sends any data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, encryption and decryption is run <em>inside</em> the browser using algorithms implemented in Rust and incorporated into the <em>myVault</em> using WebAssembly. This means that the data is never exposed outside of the browser unless it is encrypted. It also means that the algorithms run quite fast and are not exposed in javascript.</p>
<p><em>However, running the algorithms internally and not exporting the data over the internet does not guarantee that your data is secure</em>.</p>
<h3 id="over-the-shoulder-surfing-attack">Over the Shoulder Surfing Attack</h3>
<p>Internally the data is stored in decrypted form, so you may be vulnerable to over the shoulder surfing attacks where someone or something (like a camera) watches or films you typing. You could be observed opening a record and then clicking to display the password in plaintext which could allow that information to be stolen. This can be mitigated by being aware of your surroundings to make sure you are not being watched or filmed.</p>
<h3 id="clipboard-attack">Clipboard Attack</h3>
<p>Yet another type of vulnerability is clipboard attacks if/when data is copied to the clipboard for cut and paste operations. This vulnerability exists because the clipboard is a global resource that can be accessed by other, independent applications.</p>
<p>Clipboard attacks can be mitigated by making sure that your computer does not have malware installed or by not copying to the clipboard. Although it is probably impractical to not use the clipboard at all so, if you do use the clipboard, make sure that you always reset it after any copy/paste operation to minimize any chances that it will be captured by malware or observed by an attacker. You can reset it by simply selection a single letter or word and copying it.</p>
<p>Another perhaps better way to mitigate the clipboard vulnerability would be to eliminate the need for the clipboard by modifying <em>myVault</em> to automatically login in for you based on record data using an HTTP POST operation but that is not currently available.</p>
<h3 id="unattended-browser">Unattended Browser</h3>
<p>If you leave the browser unattended after you have loaded your record data, someone can sit down and see the records because they are impersonating you. This can be mitigated by always closing the webapp tab or locking your screen when you leave the computer.</p>
<h3 id="malware-key-logging-and-screen-recording">Malware: Key Logging and Screen Recording</h3>
<p>If malware has been installed on your computer that does screen shots or key logging, you are in trouble. It means that an attacker can see what you are doing and capture what you are typing. The best way to mitigate these forms of attacks is to keep your system up to data by installing security patches and use some sort of security tool to protect your system.</p>
<h3 id="website-spoofing">Website Spoofing</h3>
<p>Finally, web site spoofing could be used to direct you to a website that could be used to steal your information using a look alike webapp. To mitigate that make sure that you accessing the <em>myVault</em> from a known, trusted site.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>In summary, even security can never be guaranteed, the best way to protect your data is to follow commonly recommended security practices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep all of your security patches up to date.</li>
<li>Keep malware off of your systems.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are not observered.</li>
<li>Never share sensitive information (like passwords).</li>
<li>Backup your data.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>A theme is composed of a set of colors (foreground and background) and a set of properties that define other syle information. Each theme also has a unique name. Theme colors and properties are can be selected and/or defined on the <q><code>Preferences</code></q> page.</p>
<p>The idea behind themes is to make the CSS styling dynamic to allow users to change and save styles from the UI. The current implementation is poor because it is too complex and is not documented.</p>
<p>The current properties are <em>standard</em> and <em>large</em>. They are a first appproximation of styles that make the webapp usable for different screen sizes. I use <em>standard</em> on my laptop and <em>large</em> in landscape mode on my mobiles devices.</p>
<p>When a theme color or property is changed, the display is updated immediately.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-builtin-example">How to use the builtin example</h2>
<p>An example is provided that allows you to play with the webapp to get familiar with it.</p>
<p>It contains 11 built-in, hard-coded records that can be used to play around with the tool to learn how it is used. Note that this operation changes the password to <q><code>example</code></q> and the title to <q><code>myExample</code></q>. The password and title values can be changed to anything you want in the <q><code>Preferences</code></q>.</p>
<p>To load the example follow these steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the app in your browser: <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault</a></li>
<li>Navigate to the <q><code>Load</code></q> page from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <q><code>Internal Example</code></q> accordion entry.</li>
<li>Click the <q><code>Load Example</code></q> button.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <q><code>Records</code></q> to view the records.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the example is loaded, you can change the records from the <q><code>Records</code></q> page, add new records, save them and load them.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-the-first-record">How to create the first record</h2>
<p>Creating the first record requires you to define a master password, input the record data and save it. Here are the steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the app in your browser: <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault</a></li>
<li>Navigate to the <q><code>Preferences</code></q> page from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <q><code>Master Password</code></q> accordion entry.</li>
<li>Enter a password. I used the memorable password generator.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <q><code>Records</code></q> page from the menu.</li>
