<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>myVault</em> is single page web app, available
at <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault</a>,
that allows you to securely manage
your personal data as searchable records in a secure, flexible
manner. Each record contains arbitrary data that you care about, such
as the password for a site or the last book you read with notes. You
define the record format and contents. Each record can be
different. Both the format and the content of each record can be
changed at anytime.</p>
<p><em>myVault</em> allows you to control where the data is stored. The web app
is self contained so data is never shipped to external web site. I
tend to save my data in a file in a common place (like Google Drive
and iCloud) so that all my devices can access it. If you store your
data on a local drive make sure that it is backed up regularly.</p>
<p>The record data is protected by a master password. It is used to
encrypt all data that is exported and decrypt all data that is
imported. For more information see the <a href="#master-password">Master Password</a>
section.</p>
<p>Each record is composed of fields. A field has a name and a value. One
key feature of the program is that the field types changes based on
the field name. Thus, if a field name contains the word <code>&quot;password&quot;</code> or
<code>&quot;secret&quot;</code>, the value changes to a password input which hides the
value. If the field name contains the word <code>&quot;notes&quot;</code>, the value field
changes to a multi-line text box to allow you enter multiple lines of
text. All other fields like <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;url&quot;</code> are treated as simple
strings. Although the webapp does to try to identify <em>URLs</em> and present
them as links in view mode.</p>
<p><em>myVault</em> is very customizable. You can change the page title, the encryption
algorithm used, the page theme colors, the page theme properties like
font size, templates that define the fields used in records, the
mapping between field names and their types, and more. The
customization is done on the preferences page. Each customization
panel has some information about what it does.</p>
<p><em>myVault</em> also provides built-in password generation for both cryptic
and memorable passwords for all password fields, including the master
password. See the <a href="#master-password">Master Password</a> for details on
cryptic and memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The app also provides built in example data to allow you to play with the
capabilities without committing to anything.  It is a great way to get
familiar with the program and is also really useful during
development.</p>
<p>I use <em>myVault</em> to store my password information and keep track of
books that i have read. The books don't really need to be secure. I
simply use it because it is convenient to use on my mobile devices.</p>
<p>There is a related utility called
<em>cryptor</em> (
<a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault/xtra/cryptor.html">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault/xtra/cryptor.html</a>)
that allows you to
conveniently encrypt and decrypt any text file with arbitrary data
from the browser. You can access it from the &quot;<code>About</code>&quot; page. I
originally built it as a prototype during development but then found
it so useful that i decided to keep it. It is not part of the official
<em>myVault</em> webapp because the function, although similar, is more
general because <em>cryptor</em> does not care about the format of file
contents whereas <em>myVault</em> does care about the format.</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>This section describes the layout of the app and talks about each section in
detail.</p>
<p>All sections use accordion panels to display options. Opening the
panel provides more information about what it does. There are icons at
the top of the accordion panels that allow you to expand or collapse
all of the panels at once.</p>
<h3>Menu</h3>
<p>It all starts with the menu. Which is an icon positioned in the upper
right corner of the app window. There 5 menu options for selecting one
of the five different pages.  The pages are briefly described in the
table below and more thoroughly described in subsequent sections.</p>

<h3>Records Page</h3>
<p>Work with the records. You can add, change or delete records.  The top
level records page shows all of the records in accordion panels. You
can click on a record accordion panel to see the record details.</p>
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>There is search bar at the top that allows you search for records that
match a pattern. The search searches all of the record titles in a
case insensitive manner. The default is to search for <em>all</em>
records. The search syntax is the Javascript RegExp syntax.</p>
<p>The records list is updated as you type.</p>
<h4>Add New Record</h4>
<p>Underneath the search bar there are three buttons: a button to expand all of the
accordion panels, a button to collapse the all of the accordion panels and a &quot;+&quot; button
to add a new record. There is also a count of the number of records which match
the search criteria.</p>
<p>When you click on the add new record button a new sub-page
appears.</p>
<p>Enter the data for the fields that you want to add and click
on the &quot;Create&quot; button to create the new record.</p>
<p>Before entering any field information you can choose a record
field template from the &quot;Template&quot; selection box if you want to use
predefined fields. This is helpful if you want a common format for
the records. Note that you can define your own templates in the
&quot;Preferences&quot;.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Discard&quot; button to discard the changes and go back to the
main records page.</p>
<p>The &quot;Add Field&quot; button allows you to append a new field which is a new
row at the end with name and a value.</p>
<p>A field will not be included in a record if either the name or the
value are empty.</p>
<p>Certain field names will change the value type. For example a field
named &quot;password&quot; will create a password input. There are three value
types: string (basic input), textarea (multi-line input) and password
(a password field). The field type will change <em>as you type the name</em>.
Thus the name &quot;passwor&quot; (missing the final &quot;d&quot;) will be string field
but when you type the final &quot;d&quot;, the value field will change to a
password. You can define the mapping between field names and field
values in the &quot;Preferences&quot; in the &quot;Record Field Name Based
Types&quot; accordion entry.</p>
<h4>View Record</h4>
<p>When a record is expanded you will see a view of its contents. URLs
will be seen as links (the program figure that out automatically),
passwords will not be displayed (you can see them by clicking on the
eye icon). All fields can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the
copy icon on the far right.</p>
<h4>Delete Record</h4>
<p>A record can be deleted by clicking on the trashcan icon in view mode.
See the &quot;how to&quot; entries in subsequent sections for details.</p>
<h4>Edit Record</h4>
<p>A record can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon.
See the &quot;how to&quot; entries in subsequent sections for details.</p>
<h3>Save Page</h3>
<p>This page contains the options available for saving data. They are briefly summarized in the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Panel</th>
<th>Brief Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Paste Data to Clipboard</td>
<td>Copy the master password encrypted data to the clipboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Download to File</td>
<td>Download the master password encrypted data to a local file. If you download the file to a shared resource like Google Drive or iCloud, the file can be shared by different devices.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Master Password</h2>
<p>The record data is protected by a master password. It is used to
encrypt all data that is exported and decrypt all data that is
imported so the only data ever saved is secure which means that the
encrypted data in the stored file looks something like this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>----------------------- crypt-aes-256-gcm prefix -----------------------

----------------------- crypt-aes-256-gcm suffix -----------------------
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it is not of much use without the password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your master password is lost, the data cannot be recovered
because the program never stores it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The encryption algorithm is AES-256 which is considered quite secure
and should be relatively safe from future quantum attacks. Furthermore,
the encryption algorithm runs <em>inside</em> the browser so, as mentioned earlier,
your data is never shipped to an external server.</p>
<p>I recommend creating a memorable password (<a href="#memorable">Memorable</a> below)
because this is the <em>only</em> password that you have to remember to
access all of your password records. It may even make sense to write
it down and store it in a secure place.</p>
<h2>Automatic Password Generation</h2>
<p>all passwords (including the master password) have four extra buttons:
an eye button to let you view the password as plaintext, a single gear
button that generates a <em>cryptic</em> password, a multiple gear button
that generates a <em>memorable</em> password and a copy button that copies
the password to the clipboard that can be pasted externally.</p>
<h3>Cryptic</h3>
<p>Cryptic passwords are secure, hard to remember passwords that are a
pseudo random collection of upper case letters, lower case letters,,
numbers and special characters. Here are two examples of cryptic
passwords: &quot;<code>t0t5Q2eL!6E7!s6nWp6lv1</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>SiPeD_dLQa03NIG</code>&quot;.</p>
<h3>Memorable</h3>
<p>Memorable passwords are secure, easy to remember passwords that are
composed of three pseudo randomly chosen English words separated by a
slash. Here are two examples of memorable passwords:
&quot;<code>farming/naval/decision</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>viewed/frequencies/looking</code>&quot;.</p>
<h3>Custom</h3>
<p>The cryptic and memorable buttons make it easy to generate passwords
automatically but if you prefer another style you can always enter
your passwords manually.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p><em>myVault</em>, like all webapps or programs, has security challenges. By
understanding them you can better protect your record data.</p>
<h3>MITM</h3>
<p>Unlike many other webapps, it does <em>not</em> talk to an internet based web
server which means that the data is never transported from your
computer over the internet. Because no data is ever transmitted, it is
protected from monster-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</p>
<h3>Third Party Web Site Security</h3>
<p>Furthermore, because it does not send the data to a server, it is
not vulnerable to how cybersecurity is managed on the server by a third
party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can verify that <em>myVault</em> is not sending data out by monitoring
outbound traffic from your system. This web app never sends any data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, encryption and decryption is run <em>inside</em> the browser using
algorithms implemented in Rust and incorporated into the <em>myVault</em>
using WebAssembly. This means that the data is never exposed outside
of the browser unless it is encrypted. It also means that the
algorithms run quite fast and are not exposed in javascript.</p>
<p><em>However, running the algorithms internally and not exporting the data
over the internet does not guarantee that your data is secure</em>.</p>
<h3>Over the Shoulder Surfing Attack</h3>
<p>Internally the data is stored in decrypted form, so you may be
vulnerable to over the shoulder surfing attacks where someone or
something (like a camera) watches or films you typing. You could be
observed opening a record and then clicking to display the password in
plaintext which could allow that information to be stolen. This can be
mitigated by being aware of your surroundings to make sure you are not
being watched or filmed.</p>
<h3>Clipboard Attack</h3>
<p>Yet another type of vulnerability is clipboard attacks if/when data is
copied to the clipboard for cut and paste operations. This
vulnerability exists because the clipboard is a global resource that
can be accessed by other, independent applications.</p>
<p>Clipboard attacks can be mitigated by making sure that your computer
does not have malware installed or by not copying to the clipboard.
Although it is probably impractical to not use the clipboard at all
so, if you do use the clipboard, make sure that you always reset it
after any copy/paste operation to minimize any chances that it will be
captured by malware or observed by an attacker. You can reset it by
simply selection a single letter or word and copying it.</p>
<p>Another perhaps better way to mitigate the clipboard vulnerability
would be to eliminate the need for the clipboard by modifying <em>myVault</em>
to automatically login in for you based on record data using an
HTTP POST operation but that is not currently available.</p>
<h3>Unattended Browser</h3>
<p>If you leave the browser unattended after you have loaded your record data,
someone can sit down and see the records because they are
impersonating you. This can be mitigated by always closing the webapp
tab or locking your screen when you leave the computer.</p>
<h3>Malware: Key Logging and Screen Recording</h3>
<p>If malware has been installed on your computer that does screen shots or
key logging, you are in trouble. It means that an attacker can see what
you are doing and capture what you are typing. The best way to mitigate
these forms of attacks is to keep your system up to data by installing
security patches and use some sort of security tool to protect your
system.</p>
<h3>Website Spoofing</h3>
<p>Finally, web site spoofing could be used to direct you to a website
that could be used to steal your information using a look alike
webapp. To mitigate that make sure that you accessing the <em>myVault</em> from
a known, trusted site.</p>
<h3>Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>In summary, even security can never be guaranteed, the best way to
protect your data is to follow commonly recommended security
practices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep all of your security patches up to date.</li>
<li>Keep malware off of your systems.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are not observed.</li>
<li>Never share sensitive information (like passwords).</li>
<li>Backup your data.</li>
</ol>
<h3>MFA</h3>
<p>Several folks asked why multi-factor authentication (MFA) was not
included to provide and additional layer of security.</p>
<p>I deliberately did not include MFA because it requires an
authentication/authorization service and I want this application to
<em>never</em> talk to the internet unless the user explicitly requests
access to a known shared file service through the &quot;<code>Load</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>Save</code>&quot;
pages. In other words, you should never see any internet traffic
originating from this webapp that you cannot account for.</p>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<p>There were a couple of single page web apps that i developed while building <em>myVault</em>.
They turned out to be so useful that i left them in. They are not elegant or well
designed or well tested.</p>
<h3>Color2RGB</h3>
<p>This is a utility page that allows you to type in any color name and have it normalized
to its RGB and hex value. For example <code>red</code> --&gt; <code>#ff0000</code> and <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code>.
To access it click here: <a href="/xtra/color2rgb.html">xtra/color2rgb.html</a>.</p>
<h3>Cryptor</h3>
<p>This is a utility page that allows you to encrypt and decrypt arbitrary data
with cryptic, memorable or custom passwords.
It can load from and save to files and the clipboard.
I have found it to be very useful for encrypting arbitrary files.
To access it click here: <a href="/xtra/cryptor.html">xtra/cryptor.html</a>.</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>A theme is composed of a set of colors (foreground and background) and
a set of properties that define other style information. Each theme also
has a unique name. Theme colors and properties are can be selected and/or
defined on the &quot;<code>Preferences</code>&quot; page.</p>
<p>The idea behind themes is to make the CSS styling dynamic to allow users
to change and save styles from the UI. The current implementation is poor
because it is too complex and is not documented.</p>
<p>The current properties are <em>standard</em> and <em>large</em>. They are a first
approximation of styles that make the webapp usable for different
screen sizes. I use <em>standard</em> on my laptop and <em>large</em> in landscape
mode on my mobiles devices.</p>
<p>When a theme color or property is changed, the display is updated
immediately.</p>
<h2>How to access the app</h2>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault/">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault/</a>
in your browser.</p>
<h2>How to share a records file</h2>
<p>The easiest way to share records is to save the records file to a
shared volume from the &quot;<code>Save</code>&quot; page to a shareable resource like
<em>Google Drive</em> or <em>iCloud</em>. Then provide the password to other folks
entrusted to access the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take care in transmitting the password to keep the data safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to use the builtin example</h2>
<p>An example is provided that allows you to play with the webapp to get
familiar with it.</p>
<p>It contains 11 built-in, hard-coded records that can be used to play
around with the tool to learn how it is used. Note that this operation
changes the password to &quot;<code>example</code>&quot; and the title to &quot;<code>myExample</code>&quot;. The
password and title values can be changed to anything you want in the
&quot;<code>Preferences</code>&quot;.</p>

<h2>How to install and run locally without internet access</h2>
<p>These are the steps to run the web app locally without internet access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that you will need internet access to set things up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must have a number of dev tools installed. They are shown in the table below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The build system recognize both the tool and alternate names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aliases are for systems like Mac OS that use ancient versions of
standard tools. It allows <em>make</em> to recognize the more modern versions
that were installed with tools like <em>macports</em>.</p>
<p>Once that is done here are the steps to set it up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the project.
<ol>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jlinoff/myvault</code></li>
<li><code>cd myvault</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Build and test it locally. This is required to build the Rust components, the version data and to generate the documentation.
<ol>
<li><code>make</code> (try <code>make help</code> for info about all available targets).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run a server
<ol>
<li><code>make server</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your favorite browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want a port other than 8000 (say 9000), run <code>make server PORT=9000</code>.</p>
<h2>How to release the webapp</h2>
<p><em>myVault</em> is released by running &quot;<code>make webapp</code>&quot; after building and testing changed.
That target creates the &quot;<code>webapp.tar</code>&quot; archive which can be extracted to create a
<code>myvault</code> directory tree. Here at the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the project.
<ol>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jlinoff/myvault</code></li>
<li><code>cd myvault</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make changes.</li>
<li>Build and test it locally. This is required to build the Rust components, the version data and to generate the documentation.
<ol>
<li><code>make</code> (try <code>make help</code> for info about all available targets).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create the release archive.
<ol>
<li><code>make webapp</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Copy to the website and extract. There are many different ways to do this depending on how your website is setup.
<ol>
<li><code>scp webapp.tar your-website:/www/</code></li>
<li><code>ssh your-website &quot;cd /www/ &amp;&amp; tar xf webapp.tar &amp;&amp; rm -f webapp.tar&quot;</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to change the master password</h2>
<p>The master password must be changed after the records file has been
loaded but before it is saved. Here are the steps for a records
file named &quot;<code>mystuff.txt</code>&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the app in your browser: <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault</a></li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;<code>Preferences</code>&quot; page from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;<code>Master Password</code>&quot; accordion entry.</li>
<li>Enter the old password for &quot;<code>mystuff.txt</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;<code>Load</code>&quot; page from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;<code>Read Local File</code>&quot; accordion entry.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;<code>Select File</code>&quot; button and choose &quot;<code>mystuff.txt</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;<code>Preferences</code>&quot; page from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;<code>Master Password</code>&quot; accordion entry.</li>
<li>Enter the new password for &quot;<code>mystuff.txt</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;<code>Save</code>&quot; from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;<code>Download to File</code>&quot; accordion entry.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;<code>Download</code>&quot; button. The <em>MyVault</em> remembers the file name &quot;`mystuff.txt'&quot; so you don't have to re-enter it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to import records from JSON</h2>
<p>It is sometimes convenient to be able import many records at once. If, for example,
you want to transfer records between records files. This can be done using the
&quot;<code>Raw Edit</code>&quot; function on the &quot;<code>Preferences</code>&quot; page. This example shows how to create
a simple password record named &quot;<code>Acme Utensils for Coyotes</code>&quot;. The JSON is shown below:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-json"><code>{
  &quot;__id__&quot; : &quot;Acme Utensils for Coyotes&quot;,
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://roadrunner.io&quot;,
  &quot;username&quot;: &quot;wilec&quot;,
  &quot;password&quot;: &quot;roadrunnersaredelicious&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This JSON defines a record that follows the built-in <em>PASS4</em> records template.</p>
<p>Here are the steps required to add it the example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the app in your browser: <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault">https://jlinoff.github.io/myvault</a></li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;<code>Load</code>&quot; page from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;<code>Internal Example</code>&quot; accordion entry.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;<code>Load Example</code>&quot; button.</li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;<code>Preferences</code>&quot; to page.</li>
<li>Select the &quot;<code>Raw Edit</code>&quot; button.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the &quot;<code>Records</code>&quot; entry in the JSON textarea box.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that you can transfer records one records file to another by
using &quot;Raw Edit&quot; to copy the record file from one file and paste it to
the other file.</p>
