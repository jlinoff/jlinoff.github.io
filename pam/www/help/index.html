<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> or Personal Account Manager is a free and open source
single page web app that runs in your browser in a secure context that
enables you to securely manage your confidential personal account data
as searchable records in a secure, flexible, and persistent manner
<em>without ever having to visit a server</em> because it stores the
data in a file that you control. The file is encrypted so even if it
were stolen the data would be safe <em>if the password you used to
encrypt it was strong</em>.</p>
<p>You can run the application locally, from your own server or from the
public github.io servers here: <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html</a>.</p>
<h4 id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h4>
<p>Probably the easiest way to understand how the app works is to look
at some simple examples that reflect common ways to use the app.</p>
<h5 id="menu">Menu</h5>
<p>The menu is the control center for the app. It provides the basic
operations for creating records, loading records, saving them and it
provide information about the app including this help.</p>
<p><img src="./image03.png" alt="menu"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are seven menu options: <q>About</q>,
<q>Preferences</q>, <q>New Record</q>, <q>Clear Records</q>, <q>Load
File</q>, <q>Save File</q>, and <q>Help</q>.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./info-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> About</q>
entry to see information about the app.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Preferences</q> entry
to see the preferences dialogue which allows you to customize some of
the app behavior. There is a lot of stuff so you might want to read the
preferences section before trying it.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./plus-circle-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> New
Record</q> entry to create a new record.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./trash3-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clear
Records</q> entry to delete all of the records. This is useful for times
when you want to create a new collection of records that is saved in a
separate file. For example, if you wanted to create a collection
personal accounts in one file and a collection shared accounts for a
group of folks (like a development team sharing AWS accounts).</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-up-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Load
File</q> entry to load a records file. You will typically have to enter
a password to decrypt the file so that the records can be displayed.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-down-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Save
File</q> entry to save all of the records to a file. You will want to
enter a password to make sure that the records in the file are
encrypted. Encryption is done using the AWS-CBC-256 encryption algorithm
which is known to be secure (even to quantum attacks) but it means that
you must remember it because the file records cannot be retrieved if the
password is lost.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./question-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Help</q>
entry to see this help message.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h5 id="load-records">Load Records</h5>
<p>This example shows what the records look like. It shows seven records
that contain confidential information for <q>Amazon</q>, <q>Email</q>,
<q>Facebook</q>, <q>Github</q>, <q>Google</q>, <q>Netflix</q> and
<q>Stack Exchange</q> fictional accounts.</p>
<p>The records were created by clicking on the <q>New Record</q> option
from the menu and then adding the individual fields in some cases or by
clicking the <q>Clone</q> option on an existing record and updating the
field values for the other cases. The <q>Clone</q> operation is
particularly convenient for creating records with similar formats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The information is all made up and has no relation to any real
accounts AFAIK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./image01.png" alt="Example records"></p>
<p>As you can see there are seven records in an accordion format in the
middle of the screen. You can click on each one to expand it to make the
record data visible.</p>
<p>To get the information for an account you click or tap the
button.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h5 id="expand-record">Expand Record</h5>
<p>The most common operation is expanding a record to see the
information. This example shows the fictional <q>Facebook</q> account
data.</p>
<p><img src="./image02.png" alt="Expanded Facebook record"></p>
<p>You can see that there are three fields in the record: <q>url</q>,
<q>login</q> and <q>password</q>, next to each field there is a icon
that looks like a clipboard
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/>. If
you click or tap it the field contents will be copied to the clipboard
so that you can paste them into a login dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the fields are completely customizable. You can have as
many as you want. Fields are added, modified and deleted by the
<q>Edit</q> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the cliboard icon there is another icon that looks
like an eye <img src="./eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/>.
that shows up for password field. If you click or tap it, the password
will be shown in plaintext and the icon will change to an eye with a
slash through it
<img src="./eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye-slash"/>. By
default all passwords are hidden so that they are not visible to casual
observers. Click it again to re-hide the password.</p>
<p>In addition there are three buttons at the bottom
<q><img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Delete</q> to delete
the record,
<q><img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clone</q> to clone
the record and
<q><img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Edit</q> to
edit the record fields.</p>
<h4 id="preferences">Preferences</h4>
<p>Preferences allow you to customized the behavior of the app. The
defaults are set so that most people will never have to change
anything.</p>
<p>TBD</p>
<h4 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h4>
<p>TBD</p>
<h4 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h4>
<p>The examples in this section talk about how to use this app under
different scenarios.</p>
<h5 id="personal-account-records">Personal Account Records</h5>
<p>This is the most common usage. It is where personal account records
are stored so that you have a permanent, encrypted record of all of your
passwords.</p>
<h6 id="create-record-and-file">Create Record and File</h6>
<p>To create a file and a record follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app: <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>Or to wherever you installed it, if you built it locally.</li>
<li>This can be done from any device, like your phone, tablet or
computer but you must have access to cloud storage (on iphone and ipads
that would be iCloud).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Select the <q>Add New Record</q> option from the menu in the upper
right hand corner.</li>
<li>When the new record dialogue pops up, enter the account name as the
title, an example might be <q>Google email</q>.</li>
<li>Add fields like <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>At this point it will appear as your first record on the
display.</li>
<li>Now save it to a file by selecting <q>Save File</q> from the
menu.</li>
<li>Enter the file name, perhaps something like <q>mystuff.pam</q> or
<q>joe.pam</q> if your name is <q>Joe</q>,</li>
<li>Enter a password.
<ol type="1">
<li>This is the password that you need to access all of the records in
the file.</li>
<li>The password is <em>not</em> stored so make sure that you keep track
of it somewhere because if it is lost, the records <em>cannot</em> be
retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your data is stored. You can add as many additional
records as you want or change existing records. As long as you save
them, they will be available to you.</p>
<h6 id="use-record-data-to-log-into-a-site">Use Record Data to Log into
a Site</h6>
<p>To use the data to log into a site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the <q>url</q> link so that the site opens up in a
different tab.</li>
<li>Enter the login name or email by clicking on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the login name and paste into the site.</li>
<li>Enter the password by clicking on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the password and paste into the site.
<ol type="1">
<li>You do <em>not</em> need to make the password visible to do
this.</li>
<li>It picks up the correct password even when it is hidden.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h6 id="edit-an-existing-record">Edit an Existing Record</h6>
<p>To edit an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the edit
<img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record the same way you did when adding it.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done editing.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="delete-an-existing-record">Delete an Existing Record</h6>
<p>To delete an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the delte <img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' />
icon.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done editing.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="clone-an-existing-record">Clone an Existing Record</h6>
<p>This is a really powerful operation that allows you to quickly create
records with the same fields.</p>
<p>To clone a record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the edit <img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' />
icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record the same way you did when adding it.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done editing.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to disable the copying of field data turn off the
<q>Clone Field Values when Cloning Records</q> preference. That avoids
having to delete each old field value before typing in the new field
value.</p>
<h5 id="shared-credentials-for-a-small-group">Shared Credentials for a
Small Group</h5>
<p>This scenario assumes that a small group shares a common file of
account records with credentials that can only be decrypted using a
single shared password that is only known to the group. Because it is so
easy to manage, such simple setup it might be useful for a
<em>small</em> group that requires administrative access to a
<em>small</em> number of accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it involves sharing a password, this approach may be too
insecure for some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this approach is adopted, it would be wise to change the shared
password frequently, to audit all access to the shared file as well as
auditing all access to the accounts. Also, since the shared file
<em>must</em> be on a mounted volume that can be seen by the input file
dialogue, access to the mount and, by extension, to the file can also be
restricted.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to share the pam file.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the mounted volume.</li>
<li>Create the pam file and populate it with the shared records.
<ol type="1">
<li>Optionally, you may wish to limit the fields to <code>login</code>,
<code>password</code>, <code>note</code> and <code>host</code> by
editing the preferences and removing the other fields since these
records have a specific format.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Save the file to the mounted volume with a password.</li>
<li>Communicate the location of the file and the password to the members
of the group in a secure way.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="recipes">Recipes</h5>
<p>This is a bit of contrived example because you could easily keep all
of your recipes with your other personal account data but it might be
useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>The key notion here is the idea of creating two new fields in the
preference dialogue: <q>difficulty</q>, <q>ingredients</q> and
<q>steps</q>, and then using them when you enter recipes.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to get started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the preferences dialogue from the menu in pam.</li>
<li>Add the three new fields by clicking on the
<img src="./plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon
in the <q>Record Fields</q> section.
<ol type="1">
<li><q>difficulty</q> of type <q>text</q>.</li>
<li><q>ingredients</q> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
<li><q>steps</q> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete all of the other fields by clicking on the trashcan
<img src="./trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/>
icon.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search by an ingredient, set the <q>Search Record Field Values</q>
preference to true by clicking on it and then saving it.</p>
<h5 id="books">Books</h5>
<p>This is another somewhat of contrived example because you could
easily keep all of your book reviews with your other personal account
data but it might be useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>For my book reviews, I enter the book title as the record title and
added the following fields using the methodology described in the
recipes section above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that i only add records or books that i have completed.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>

<tr class="header">

<p>To search by author, set the <q>Search Record Field Values</q>

<h4 id="developer-notes">Developer Notes</h4>
<p>These are things that developers might be interested in.</p>
<p>It was built using pure javascript and relies on a secure context to
provide encryption and decryption.</p>
<p>It uses <a
href="#https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a>
to make it work better in mobile browsers.</p>
<p>All of the FOSS (free and open source).</p>
<h5 id="release-pam">Release PAM</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the <code>VERSION</code> file using semantic versioning.</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to propagate the new version.</li>
<li>Run <code>make app-help</code> to propagate any changes to
<code>HELP.md</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>make web</code> to create <code>pam-www.tar</code> which
contains the app in <code>pam/www</code>. It can be used to release to a
secure (HTTPS) server. The app cannot be used on a non-secure (HTTP)
server because it requires a secure context.</li>
