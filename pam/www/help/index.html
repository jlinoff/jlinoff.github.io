<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> or Personal Account Manager is a free open source single
page web application that helps you manage your confidential information
as searchable records in a secure and persistent manner <em>without ever
having to rely on backend services from a third party server</em>.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> can do that because it runs in your browser and because
it stores the <em>your information</em> in a file that <em>you
control</em>.</p>
<p>The file is encrypted so even if it were stolen the data would be
safe <em>if the password you used to encrypt it was strong</em>.</p>
<p>You can access <em>PAM</em> from your own HTTP server (including
localhost) or from the public github.io server <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>See the <em><a href="#security-considerations">Security
Considerations</a></em> and <em><a
href="#reasons-to-consider-using-pam">Reasons to consider using
PAM</a></em> sections below if you are interested in what motivated me
to write <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<p>This is not the first tool I have written to manage passwords but it
is meant to be the last. If you are interested in the genesis of
<em>PAM</em> and the stories of its predecessors see the <a
href="#history">History</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a pretty simple application. I think of it as a
record editor that runs in your browser that allows you to create
records with interesting information that can then be stored and
retrieved in a secure way.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-not-use-pam">Reasons to not use PAM</h3>
<p>It is very reasonable to ask yourself why, if <em>PAM</em> is like an
editor, you can’t simply just use something like an Excel spreadsheet or
a text file editor or keep passwords on sheets of paper or use one of
the many commercially available password managers?</p>
<p>That is an excellent question. The answer is that you <em>can</em>
and, if you are already using an Excel spreadsheet or a text file editor
or a sheet of paper or a password management service or anything other
method that works well for you, <em>you should</em>.</p>
<p>Even if you do not already have a method for managing passwords
<em>PAM</em> may not be the right choice. <em>PAM</em> requires that you
understand a bit about HTML input and textarea elements which may be
confusing. Also the <em>PAM</em> user interface (UI) and record data
model may be confusing or hard to understand and use because I am not a
UI programmer.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I wrote <em>PAM</em> to provide some features
I wanted and to address some concerns I had with existing approaches.
Those features and concerns are discussed in the next section to help
you understand my reasoning so that you can decide whether any of them
are important to you. If you don’t care about the features and the
concerns that bother me, there is no reason to use this tool.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-consider-using-pam">Reasons to consider using
PAM</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, I wrote <em>PAM</em> to provide
some features I wanted and to address some concerns I had with existing
approaches. This section lists those concerns and features in the each
of reasons presented below.</p>
<h4 id="reason-1-no-client-server-communications">Reason 1: No Client
Server Communications</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a single page web application (SPA) that has no
backend which means that it never communicates with an external site
which protects it from some types of cyber attacks as detailed in the <a
href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</h4>
<p>In <em>PAM</em>, information is organized into files composed of
records that each have a unique title and are, in turn, composed of
fields that have a name, a type and a value. This approach is similar to
organizing information using recipe cards or a rolodex.</p>
<p>Following the recipe card analogy a little further, we can use a
simple example to understand the record model a bit better.</p>
<p>A recipe would be a single record that might contain the
<em>title</em> (the name of the recipe), the <em>ingredients</em> (a
field) and the <em>instructions</em> (another field). It would certainly
be possible to organize it differently but this is fine for such a
simple example.</p>
<p>So what would a dessert record (recipe) look like in <em>PAM</em>?
Well, if you had a simple dessert recipe like this written on a
card.</p>
<pre><code>Ice Cream Sundae

ingredients
1. 3 scoops vanilla ice cream
2. 1 banana (sliced up)
3. chocolate sauce
4. (optional) nuts
5. (optional) Maraschino cherry
6. whipped cream

instructions
1. put ice cream in bowl
2. add slices of banana
3. add nutes
4. pour chocolate on top
5. add whip cream
6. put the cherry on top.</code></pre>
<p>It might look like this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae.png" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>As you can see, in this <em><q>recipe</q></em> record, the title is
<code>"Ice Cream Sundae"</code> and the two fields <q>ingredients</q>
and <q>instructions</q> contain the multiline (<code>textarea</code>)
descriptions of what the ingredients and instructions are for this
specific recipe.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other types of records that might be
interesting to store in <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<p>One common one is a record for each account that you need to login
into where you information about how to login is stored so you don’t
have to remember it.</p>
<p>Such an <em><q>account</q></em> record would have, at a minimum, the
web address (URL), the login name and the password of the account.</p>
<p>Note that this is simplified example is only meant to show the basic
idea of importance of support <em>other</em> record formats.</p>
<p>For a real account record, you might also want to keep track of the
secrets the site asks you to enter so that it can identify you if you
ever lose your password (unlikely if you are using this tool or some
other tool like it).</p>
<p>The secrets they ask for might be something like your mothers maiden
name or the name of your first pet or other such, personal, things. I am
always wary of entering that kind of information on a third party site
because it can be stolen and used against you so I <em>always</em> make
things up, like me first car might be a <q>Saturn V</q> (as in the
rocket), which gets hard to remember for many sites with many made up
secrets.</p>
<p>Or, you might want to keep a note to remind you of little details
about the account (like your favorite customer service representative)
but since you can always add new fields <em>after</em> you create a
record, leaving them out for now is not a big deal.</p>
<p>Here is what a simple account record might look like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-account.png" alt="google-account-example"></p>
<p>In the account example above, the record title is
<code>"Google"</code>, the <q>url</q> field value is
<code>"https://google.com"</code>, the <q>login</q> field value is
<code>"pbrain81@gmail.com"</code> and the <q>password</q> field value is
hidden because <em>PAM</em> hides the contents of passwords by
default.</p>
<p>As you can see both records look quite different. Recipes records
have fields for <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> whereas
account records have fields for the <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and
<q>password</q>. In both cases they have the same basic structure: a
title and a set of fields that are relevant to them.</p>
<p>You could easily imagine defining other records that contain
information for other topics like <em><q>books read</q></em> or
<em><q>unidentified aerial phenomena</q></em> or <em><q>bird
watching</q></em> which would undoubtedly require additional, different
fields.</p>
<p>In my view, this <em>fields in records</em> organization does a
better job of representing this type of information than a spreadsheet
or a text file editor.</p>
<h4 id="reason-3-searching">Reason 3: Searching</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> allows you to search records by their title or their
field names and values. It also filters out the records that don’t match
to make it easier to see the matching records visually.</p>
<p>The availability of fast interactive searching makes finding records
easy.</p>
<p>See <a href="#search-records">Search Records</a> for more
details.</p>
<h4 id="reason-4-automatic-password-generation">Reason 4: Automatic
Password Generation</h4>
<p>I always find it hard to come up with passwords in the spur of the
moment so <em>PAM</em> was built with the ability to automatically
generate passwords.</p>
<p>Of course almost all browsers and password tools provide this same
capability nowadays, but they tend to generate secure, cryptic, hard to
memorize passwords which is perfectly fine for passwords for most
accounts.</p>
<p>But there are a cases when a more memorable, easy to type password is
desirable such as the login password for your work computer, where there
is no way to easily access and use a password management system and the
ability to type the password easily is important because you can’t paste
it from the clipboard.</p>
<p>To make these concepts a bit clearer, here are examples of a cryptic
and a memorable password</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><!-- --></th>
<th><!-- --></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cryptic</td>
<td><code>Rf5NaR7LH2LbZMRhkPCfeG8</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>memorable</td>
<td><code>A1/health/mpegs/hopes!!</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a result, <em>PAM</em> was built with the ability to generate
<em>cryptic</em> and <em>memorable</em> passwords.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about password generation in
<em>PAM</em> see the <a href="#password-fields">Password Fields</a>
section.</p>
<h4 id="reason-5-file-based-storage">Reason 5: File Based Storage</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> uses files to load and store the record data.</p>
<p>Using a file means that the user does not have to rely on the
cybersecurity infrastructure of a company running a web server and
storing your data at their site or another third party site. This was
alluded in <a href="#reason-1-no-client-server-communications">Reason 1:
No Client Server Communications</a> but that is not the <em>only</em>
advantage of using files.</p>
<p>A <em>PAM</em> file is composed of a set of records. Any records you
like. You can use a single file for all of your records or you can have
multiple files where each file contains records that are somehow related
like records of <em><q>recipes</q></em> or <em><q>book reviews</q></em>
or <em><q>my favorite species of Euglena</q></em>.</p>
<p>What this means is that you can group records associated by a topic
in different files to make them easier to organize and find. This
ability to organize files around topics is one the reasons I prefer the
file based storage model.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion about how the user controls the
organization of the records and fields in a file see the <a
href="#reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</a> section of this
document.</p>
<p>As a side note, I store my <em>PAM</em> record files in iCloud
<em>IaaS</em> storage (infrastructure as a service) that is
automatically mounted as a local volume on each device so that the files
look like they are local but they are, in fact, stored in the cloud.
That allows me to access the files from any of my devices: laptops,
phones and tablets.</p>
<p>Of course you could simply load and save the data to a local file but
that <em>might</em> restrict your ability to access to it from other
devices (like mobile phones or tables). Not only that but you would have
to be very diligent about keeping it backed up so that you would not
lose data if the local file was corrupted or lost.</p>
<h4 id="reason-6-secure-context-encryption">Reason 6: Secure Context
Encryption</h4>
<p>When records are stored in a <em>PAM</em> file they can be encrypted
using a password. The password is then used by an <a
href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program"><em>NIST
certified</em></a>, symmetric encryption algorithm:
<code>AES-256-CBC</code> to encode the records.</p>
<p>Using a certified encryption algorithm provides a strong security
guarantee which means, that if an encrypted <em>PAM</em> file is stolen,
the record data is considered safe from hackers trying to crack the
contents <em>if a strong password was used</em>.</p>
<p>A password like <em><q>secret</q></em> or <em><q>password123</q></em>
is <em>not</em> strong and will not protect your data because it is easy
to guess.</p>
<p><em>Always</em> use a strong password to make it hard to guess.
Typically a strong password would at least 20 characters would not
include any personally identifiable information (PII) like your name,
birth date or address. Also never ever use the same password for two
different sites.</p>
<p>I recommend reading <a
href="#https://www.auditboard.com/blog/nist-password-guidelines/">NIST
Password Guidelines</a> for more information about how to create strong
passwords.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, note that <code>AES-256-CBC</code> algorithm
is considered to be reasonably resistant to quantum attacks as discussed
in the literature. For example, <a
href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6712/is-aes-256-a-post-quantum-secure-cipher-or-not">here</a>
is one relevant exchange from a <code>crypto.stackexchange.com</code>
discussion.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> encryption and decryption operations are provided by and
run <em>inside</em> the <em>secure context</em> of the browser. This is
the same <em>secure context</em> used for accessing sites securely for
transactions, like your bank. In practice this means that you must
access <em>PAM</em> from an HTTPS site.</p>
<p>The safety and security of <em>secure context</em> operations is
taken very seriously by the internet standards organization and the
organizations that develop the major browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="reason-7-hiding-passwords-from-causal-observers">Reason 7:
Hiding Passwords from Causal Observers</h4>
<p>Passwords and other secrets are automatically hidden on the screen
(displayed as asterisks) so that someone looking over your shoulder
cannot read them unless you choose to make them visible. You can read
more about why this is beneficial in the <a
href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a> section.</p>
<p>This is the default hidden view of a password.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-hidden.png" alt="password-hidden"></p>
<p>This is the view of a password when it is not hidden.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-shown.png" alt="password-shown"></p>
<h4 id="reason-8-access-from-mobile-devices">Reason 8: Access from
mobile devices</h4>
<p>The files can be accessed from mobile devices so the user has access
to the records anywhere. <em>PAM</em> uses <a
href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a>
to make the interface work better in mobile browsers.</p>
<h4 id="reason-9-foss">Reason 9: FOSS</h4>
<p>Last but not least, one compelling reason to try <em>PAM</em> is that
it is free and open source software (FOSS) so you can try it without any
obligation or cost. You can also help find and fix bugs or customize it
yourself.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a simple single page web application (SPA). It
consists of three basic parts: the menu and search section, the records
section and the status section.</p>
<p>It looks something like this</p>
<p><img src="./pam-basic-sections.png" alt="menu-bar"></p>
<h3 id="menu-and-search-section">Menu and Search Section</h3>
<p>The top section that contains a search input and a menu.</p>
<p>The search input is used to find records that match the input to make
them easier to find.</p>
<p>The menu at the top right is the control center for the application
it has a number of options as you can see below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-basic-menu.png" alt="menu"></p>
<h3 id="records-section">Records Section</h3>
<p>Underneath the top level bar is the records section. Each record is
shown as an entry that is displayed by its title. If you click or tap on
the record title, the record will expand to show the record contents
(fields) and provide options for deleting, cloning or editing the record
contents.</p>
<p>This way of presenting the records is called an accordion display.
Below you can see how it expands after the <q>Facebook</q> entry has
been selected.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>As you can see the expanded <q>Facebook</q> record has three fields:
<q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can copy the field values to the clipboard so that they can be
pasted into login forms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the copy works for passwords whether the password is
visible or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields2.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can also click or tap on the title of the opened record to close
it.</p>
<h3 id="status-section">Status Section</h3>
<p>Below the records section is the section where ephemeral status
messages are displayed. The messages disappear after about 1.5 seconds
but the duration is controlled by a preference that you can set. See the
<a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>The status messages are used to provide activity feedback like
showing how many bytes were copied to a clipboard when a copy button is
clicked or tapped as shown in the example below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-status-msg.png" alt="status-message"></p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>The following sections will go over the basic functions that
<em>PAM</em> provides.</p>
<p>In a nutshell they are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Display information about the application.</li>
<li>Create Record.</li>
<li>Edit Record.</li>
<li>Delete Record.</li>
<li>Clone Record.</li>
<li>Save records to an encrypted file.</li>
<li>Load a collection of records from an encrypted file.</li>
<li>Search Records.</li>
<li>Get Help.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each function will be discussed in a separate subsection below.</p>
<p>Note that Preferences were not included because they have their own
top level section in this document.</p>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Click or tap on the <q>About</q> menu entry to get information about
<em>PAM</em>. You can even add custom HTML through the preferences.</p>
<p>Here is a screen shot of what you would see.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about.png" alt="about"></p>
<p>Here is the annotated view</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-annotated.png" alt="about-annotated"></p>
<p>Here is an about dialogue with a simple custom message.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-custom.png" alt="about-custom"></p>
<p>Custom messages are defined in preferences as follows.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-custom-pref.png" alt="about-custom-pref"></p>
<p>The motivation for allowing custom messages is that someone might
want to share a <em>PAM</em> file. The custom message would allow the
person to provide their <em>imprimatur</em> on the collection.</p>
<h3 id="create-record">Create Record</h3>
<p>This is a long section because it covers a number of general concepts
that are needed by other functions like <q>topics</q> and
<q>fields</q>.</p>
<p>Creating a record is a very common activity in <em>PAM</em> so I
tried to make it as easy as possible.</p>
<p>There are three different methods you can use to create records:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A record can be created in the application by clicking or tapping
the <q>New Record</q> menu option,</li>
<li>A record can be created in the application by cloning an existing
record or</li>
<li>A record can be created outside of the application by editing
javascript.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three approaches will be discussed below in more detail.</p>
<p>The first method, creating the record by clicking or tapping the
<q>New Record</q> menu option in the application, is probably the best
way to create the first new record for a topic family. This is also
known as the <q>menu</q> approach.</p>
<p>The second method, creating a record by cloning an existing record,
is useful when you want to use the same fields as the existing record.
It is a great way to guarantee uniformity. Although if the number of
fields is small using the first method is also fine.</p>
<p>The third method, creating a record by editing javascript, is most
useful if you are interested in creating records programmatically
(perhaps a subset of accounts that shared with a small group of users
that is automatically generated from a database).</p>
<p>But, before any of the record creation approaches can be discussed in
more detail, it is very important to understand record topics and record
fields.</p>
<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>
<p>Topics are a way of organizing records that have similar fields.</p>
<p>Topics are completely arbitrary associations between records that are
defined by you based what is important to you. For example, a topic
could be something like <em><q>recipes</q></em>,
<em><q>accounts</q></em>, or <em><q>unidentified aerial
phenomena</q></em> or <em><q>my favorite mathematical
spaces</q></em>.</p>
<p>One way to use topics is to help you organize records in files. For
example you could define a <q><code>recipes.pam</code></q> file for all
of your recipe records and an <q><code>accounts.pam</code></q> for your
account records. Or, you could put all of your records, irregardless of
topic, into a single file like <q><code>mystuff.pam</code></q>.</p>
<p>Either way, topics provide a useful abstraction for describing the
fundamental organizing principle.</p>
<h4 id="fields">Fields</h4>
<p>Records are composed of fields. Each field has a name, a type and a
value.</p>
<p>The field name is arbitrary and is meant to describe the data in the
field. For example, an <q>ingredients</q> field would indicate that the
value is a list of ingredients.</p>
<p>The field type describes the type of data. The available types are
described in detail below.</p>
<p>The field value is the unique value for the field in an individual
record. For example, a <q>url</q> field in a record would have different
value than the <q>url</q> field in a different record.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I decided to tightly bind the field name and
type so that the field name unambiguously defines the type. That means
that a field like <code>"login"</code> is always a <code>"text"</code>
field. It will never be a phone number or a date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note this keeps things simple by not having multiple fields with the
same name but different types which would add more complexity to the
UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fields are defined in <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> and they
are stored in each file with the along with the records. Here is what
they are by default.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-predefined-fields.png" alt="predefined-fields"></p>
<p>You can change them at any time. Because the fields are stored in
each file they can be different for each topic file, if you choose to
organize things that way.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is very flexible so it doesn’t impose any strict rules
on the fields. Thus, you can also change the names of the pre-defined
fields when creating a new record. They are only provided for
convenience.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-change-field-name.png" alt="change-field-name"></p>
<p>The field types are based on HTML element input types and that is, in
fact, how they are presented to the user in the preferences dialogue.
Here is a brief overview of the types and when to use them. You can
search the web for more details.</p>

<col style="width: 55%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="header">
<th>Type</th>
<th>Usage</th>
</tr>

datetime value. A typical usage might be the date that you finished
reading a book.</td>

<td>A string, like a name or keyword. You can use this for anything. A
typical usage might be a login name where the value might be a name like
<q>wiley</q> or an email like <q>wcoyote@acme.io</q> or a number like
<q>12345678</q>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>textarea</td>
<td>A multi-line text box. A typical usage might be a note or a list of
recipe ingredients. Note that this is <em>not</em> strictly speaking an
HTML input element type, it is a separate element. It is treated as an
input type here for convenience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>url</td>
<td>A text string that is a uniform resource locator (URL). Use it if
you <em>only</em> want to accept a URL value. A typical usage might be
the path to an account like https://google.com</td>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember that the types were not made up by me, they were taken
directly from input element description <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input">here</a>,
the separate textarea element is described <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is oftentimes the case that all of the <em>available</em> types
are not needed for the records you are keeping. This is especially true
in cases where you have a very clear understanding of the record field
requirements.</p>
<p>If that is the case you might want to use the preferences to delete
fields that are not relevant for your usage so that they don’t clutter
up the choices. You can always add them back later if you want.</p>
<p>Here is an example that shows a recipe record with <q>ingredients</q>
and <q>instructions</q> fields.</p>

<p>Here is what the preferences look like with the other fields pruned

<p><img src="./pam-google-account-prefs.png" alt="google-account-example-prefs"></p>
<h4 id="password-fields">Password Fields</h4>
<p>Passwords fields show up in a lot of places. I chose to document them
here because you will probably first encounter them when creating a
record.</p>
<p>Password fields are a special case for the following three
reasons.</p>
<p>First, they provide a generator that allows you to automatically
create passwords at the click or tap of a button. For information about
preferences that can be used to customize password generation see <a
href="#password-preferences">Password Preferences</a></p>
<p>Second, they always hide the value by default so that it can be seen
by someone observing your screen.</p>
<p>And, finally, because they provide the ability to generate two
different types of passwords: cryptic and memorable.</p>
<h5 id="cryptic-passwords">Cryptic Passwords</h5>
<p>Cryptic passwords consist of letters, digits and special characters
in a single string.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <code>'N5yAb!XfGa3vELPsK95K4/AAz8mts'</code>.</p>
<p>Cryptic passwords tend to be hard to memorize for most people.</p>
<h5 id="memorable-passwords">Memorable Passwords</h5>
<p>Memorable passwords are composed of lower case English words with an
optional prefix, an optional separator between each word and an optional
suffix.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>.</p>
<p>Memorable passwords tend to be easier to memorize than cryptic
passwords for most people.</p>
<h5 id="hidden-password-representation">Hidden Password
Representation</h5>
<p>Here is an example that shows a password in its standard hidden
form.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>To make the password visible, click or tap on the
<img src="./eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon.</p>
<h5 id="visible-password-representation">Visible Password
Representation</h5>
<p>Here is an example that shows a password in its visible hidden
form.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-password.png" alt="record-expanded-password"></p>
<p>To hide the password, click or tap on the
<img src="./eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon.</p>
<h5 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h5>
<p>This is what the password field dialogue looks like with no
generator.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-no-generator.png" alt="password-no-generator"></p>
<p>When you click or tap on the
<img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon, cryptic and
memorable passwords are generated and the password generator dialogue
appears.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-generator.png" alt="password-generator"></p>
<p>As you can see it always generates five memorable passwords to
provide some choices. I found that more useful than the original
implementation which only had a single choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to present five memorable passwords was completely
arbitrary but it seems to work well enough for my needs and easily be
changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the password generator looks like with annotations.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-generator-annotated.png" alt="password-generator-annotated"></p>
<p>If you click or tap on the
<img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon a second time, new
passwords will be generated.</p>
<p>You must click or tap on the
<img src='./x-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon to close the
dialogue.</p>
<p>I chose this approach because I wanted the <img src='./gear.svg'
height='32' width='32' /> icon to be used to generate new passwords.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, that choice may not have been the most intuitive way
to implement closing the generator dialogue it but it works well enough
and can easily be changed if it turns out to be too cumbersome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To choose a generated password simply click or tap on it and it will
be added to the field value.</p>
<h4 id="method-1-menu-approach">Method 1: Menu Approach</h4>
<p>Click or tap on the <code>"New Record"</code> option from the
menu.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-menu.png" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>That will popup a dialogue that looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record.png" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>You can now type in the record title.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-title.png" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>From there you click or tap on the <code>"Type"</code> pulldown to
select and create the first record field. Don’t worry if you select the
wrong one, they are easy to delete.</p>
<p>For this example we will choose <q>note</q> because it is a
<q>textarea</q> field and then rename it to <q>ingredients</q> and type
in some basic ingredients in the value input.</p>
<p>Here is where you select <q>note</q> for the first field.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-field-1-select.png" alt="new-record-field-1-select"></p>
<p>And then change the field name to <q>ingredients</q> and populate
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that you can customize the available fields in the
preferences so that the list of fields is shorter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-field-1.png" alt="new-record-field-1"></p>
<p>Now do the same thing to create a <q>instructions</q> field. Remember
to choose <q>note</q> just like in the previous step. This is what it
looks like after you have added the second field.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-field-2.png" alt="new-record-field-2"></p>
<p>One interesting thing to note is that you can <em>change the order of
the fields</em> by dragging them up or down. To do that select the field
title at the top of the box (fieldset) and move it.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like when I dragged the <q>instructions</q>
field up.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-drag.png" alt="new-record-drag"></p>
<p>I then dragged <q>instructions</q> field back down because it should
appear after <q>ingredients</q> field.</p>
<p>When you are finished click or tap on the <code>"Save"</code> button
to save it and you will see it show up as a new record in the records
part of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-done.png" alt="new-record-done"></p>
<p>You can click or tap on the record to expand it and see the fields
you just defined.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-done-expand.png" alt="new-record-done-expand"></p>
<h4 id="method-2-clone-approach">Method 2: Clone Approach</h4>
<p>Cloning a record is simple. Just expand a record and click or tap on
the clone button and an edit dialogue pops up.</p>
<p>Using the record that was created in the previous section here is
what happens when you click or tap the <code>"Clone"</code> button.</p>
<p><img src="pam-clone-record-popup.png" alt="clone-record-popup"></p>
<p>As you can see, the clone operation created a new record with a
slightly modified title <q>Ice Cream Sundae Clone</q> <em>because the
record title must be unique</em> and the same fields as the original
record.</p>
<p>At this point you would typically change the title and field values
but for this demonstration will not do anything. <em>PAM</em> makes sure
that the title is unique so it can be saved.</p>
<p>Click or tap the <code>"Save"</code> button and you will see
this.</p>
<p><img src="pam-clone-records-1.png" alt="clone-records-1"></p>
<p>As you can see, <em>PAM</em> still remembers that you had the
original record open. Just below it you will see the new cloned
record.</p>
<p>The reason that the original record is left open is so that it is
easy to continue clicking or tapping the <code>"Clone"</code> button to
create more records.</p>
<p>In this case we only care about one record so you can click or tap on
the new record to expand it.</p>
<p><img src="pam-clone-records-2.png" alt="clone-records-1"></p>
<h4 id="method-3-javascript-approach">Method 3: Javascript Approach</h4>
<p>This approach is not going to have any screenshots because it deals
with <em>PAM</em> internals and may change from time to time. Instead a
set of instructions is provided that should allows you to figure it out
pretty easily.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create one record using the menu approach.</li>
<li>Save the record to a file <em>without a password</em>. Normally this
is a very bad idea because it could expose your data to a hacker so take
precautions to protect the file.</li>
<li>Look at the <q>records</q> section of the file and use that as a
template to create more records.</li>
<li>When you have finished adding the new records into the file, save
the changes and then re-load the file in <em>PAM</em>.</li>
<li>Then save it again <em>with a password</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason that this has to be done without a password is because I
have not yet written a command line utility to encrypt/decrypt the
files. It should be straightforward to do because it uses the standard
<code>"AWS_256-CBC"</code> algorithm.</p>

</details>
<h3 id="edit-record">Edit Record</h3>
<p>To edit a record, select it from the records list and click or tap on
the <code>"Edit"</code> button to popup the edit dialogue <em>which is
exactly the same</em> as the dialogue used to create record.</p>
<p>In fact, it is implemented using the <em>same code</em> so you can
use the instructions from the <a href="#create-record">Create Record</a>
section to understand how to change or add new fields.</p>
<h3 id="delete-record">Delete Record</h3>
<p>To delete a record, select it from the records list and click or tap
on the <code>"Delete"</code> button.</p>
<p><strong>Beware!!! PAM trusts you!!</strong></p>
<p><em>PAM</em> will not ask you if you <em>really</em> want to delete
the record. It will just go ahead and delete it without fanfare <em>so
be careful</em>.</p>
<h3 id="clone-record">Clone Record</h3>
<p>To clone a record, select it from the records list and click or tap
on the <code>"Clone"</code> button. This will create a new record that
you can edit.</p>
<p>The clone operation is described in detail in the <a
href="#create-record">Create Record</a> section under the <a
href="#method-2-clone-approach">Method 2: Clone Approach</a>
subsection.</p>
<h3 id="save-file">Save File</h3>
<p>To save records and preferences to a file by choose the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-down-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Save
File</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section
for screenshots.</p>
<p>This is the save file dialogue.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-file-save.png" alt="file-save"></p>
<p>If you want the records to be encrypted, enter or generate a password
as described in <a href="#password-generator">Password Generator</a>
section.</p>
<p>Make sure that you do not forget this password. It is the
<em>master</em> password this is used to unlock all of the records and
<em>PAM</em> does <em>not</em> keep track of it. That means that if the
password is lost, <em>PAM</em> cannot recover the data it is lost
forever.</p>
<p>More details about the encryption algorithm used can be found in <a
href="#reason-6-secure-context-encryption">Reason 6: Secure Context
Encryption</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if you do not enter a password, the output will be plain
javascript that can be read by anyone.</p>
<p>Plain javascript is <em>NOT</em> secure.</p>
<p>If you have records with passwords <em>ALWAYS</em> use a password
unless you understand the consequences. For example, saving the data
without a password can sometimes be convenient because it allows you to
see how the <em>PAM</em> data is organized which can aid automation.</p>
<h3 id="load-file">Load File</h3>
<p>To load records and preferences from a file by choose the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-up-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Load
File</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section
for screenshots.</p>
<p>This is the load file dialogue.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-file-load.png" alt="file-load"></p>
<p>If the file was saved with a password, you must enter that password
or the file will not load.</p>
<h3 id="search-records">Search Records</h3>
<p><em>PAM</em> allows you to search records by their title or their
field names and values to filter out records that do not match the
search pattern. This is extremely useful when the number of records
grows.</p>
<p>The search function supports case insensitive searches and regular
expressions to make it easier to find stuff.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful for finding out where old passwords and
obsolete accounts are still being used.</p>
<p>Here is an made up list of accounts:</p>
<p><img src="./pam-search.png" alt="pam-search"></p>
<p>Here is the same list after filtering for those whose titles contain
the letter <code>"g"</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-search-g.png" alt="pam-search-g"></p>
<p>To filter only those that start with <code>"g"</code> you would use
this regular expression search term instead: <code>"^g"</code>.</p>
<p>For more information about regular expression syntax see the
documentation for <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">Javascript
Regular Expressions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="get-help">Get Help</h3>
<p>To get this help message, choose the <code>"Help"</code> option from
the menu.</p>

of this help and click or tap on the project link.</p>
<h2 id="menu">Menu</h2>
<p>The menu is the control center for the app. It provides the basic
operations for creating records, loading records, saving them and it
provide information about the app including this help.</p>
<p>Note that much of this material presented here has been discussed in
earlier sections but having it consolidated here might be helpful. Plus
there are links to the sections with relevant details.</p>
<p>This is what the menu looks like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-menu.png" alt="menu"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are seven menu options: <q>About</q>,
<q>Preferences</q>, <q>New Record</q>, <q>Clear Records</q>, <q>Load
File</q>, <q>Save File</q>, and <q>Help</q>.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./info-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> About</q>

<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./trash3-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clear
Records</q> entry to delete all of the records. This is useful for times
when you want to create a new collection of records that is saved in a
separate file. For example, if you wanted to create a collection
personal accounts in one file and a collection shared accounts for a
group of folks (like a development team sharing AWS accounts).</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-up-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Load

<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h2 id="records">Records</h2>
<p>This section talks about how records are presented in <em>PAM</em>
using an example with seven records that contain confidential
information for <q>Amazon</q>, <q>Email</q>, <q>Facebook</q>,
<q>Github</q>, <q>Google</q>, <q>Netflix</q> and <q>Stack Exchange</q>
fictional accounts.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#create-record">Create Record</a> section for
details about how to create records.</p>
<h3 id="unexpanded-view-of-all-records">Unexpanded View of all
Records</h3>
<p>We start with the unexpanded view of all records as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-example-records.png" alt="example-records"></p>
<p>As you can see <em>PAM</em> presents the records as an accordion.
Each record is one entry in the accordion that you can expand to view
the record fields or <a href="#delete-record">delete</a>, <a
href="#clone-record">clone</a> or <a href="#edit-record">edit</a> edit
the record.</p>
<p>To get the information for an account you click or tap the
button.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h3 id="expanded-view-of-a-record">Expanded View of a Record</h3>
<p>Once you click on or tap a record it expands as shown below where the
<q>Facebook</q> record was tapped.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can see that there are three fields in the record: <q>url</q>,
<q>login</q> and <q>password</q>, next to each field there is a icon
that looks like a clipboard
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>If you click or tap the clipboard icon, the field contents will be
copied to the clipboard so that you can paste them into a login
dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the fields are completely customizable. You can have as
many as you want. Fields are added, modified and deleted by the
<q>Edit</q> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the clipboard icon there is another icon that looks
like an eye <img src="./eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/>.
that shows up for password field. If you click or tap it, the password
will be shown in plaintext and the icon will change to an eye with a
slash through it
<img src="./eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye-slash"/>. By
default all passwords are hidden so that they are not visible to casual
observers. Click or tap it again to re-hide the password.</p>
<p>In addition there are three buttons at the bottom
<q><img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Delete</q> to delete
the record,
<q><img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clone</q> to clone
the record and
<q><img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Edit</q> to
edit the record fields.</p>
<p>As you can see here.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields2.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences allow you to customized the behavior of the app. The
defaults are set so that most people will never have to change
anything.</p>
<p>The preferences dialogue is a big one. It is broken into 4 sections
to make it easier to understand:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Search - preferences that control searches.</li>
<li>Passwords - preferences that control password creation and
length.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous - preferences for other stuff.</li>
<li>Record Fields - the definitions of the available fields.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each preference is discussed in more detail in the subsections
below.</p>
<h3 id="search-preferences">Search Preferences</h3>
<p>These preferences control search options.</p>
<h4 id="case-insensitive-searches">Case Insensitive Searches</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches are case insensitive, otherwise they are
case sensitive.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-titles">Search Record Titles</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record titles, otherwise they do
not.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-field-names">Search Record Field Names</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field names, otherwise
they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that
contained a specific field.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-field-values">Search Record Field Values</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field values, otherwise
they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that
contained a specific field value like an obsolete email or really old
password.</p>
<h3 id="password-preferences">Password Preferences</h3>
<p>These preferences control automatic password creation.</p>
<p>For more information about passwords see <a
href="#password-fields">Password Fields</a></p>
<h4 id="minimum-password-length">Minimum Password Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable
passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 12.</p>
<p>I would recommend not making it shorter than the default unless a
website specifically demands it because shorter passwords are easier to
crack.</p>
<h4 id="maximum-password-length">Maximum Password Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable
passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 32.</p>
<p>I would recommend making it longer than the default if you can but
many websites have an upper bound for the length of password. The chosen
default seems to work for most of them.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-min-word-length">Memorable Password Min Word
Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum size of a word in a generated memorable password.
&gt; It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 2.</p>
<p>If you do not want short words like <code>'as'</code> or
<code>'it'</code>, then make this longer. I would not recommend making
it shorter.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-word-separator">Memorable Password Word
Separator</h4>
<p>The string used to separate the words in a generated memorable
password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is a single character: <code>'/'</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the character, add any string that you like. It
can be multiple characters. Other reasonable choices might be
<code>':'</code> or <code>'.'</code> or <code>'@@'</code> or whatever
you like. It is best not to use letters.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-min-words">Memorable Password Min Words</h4>
<p>The minimum number of words in a generated memorable password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 3.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-max-tries">Memorable Password Max Tries</h4>
<p>The maximum number of attempts to generate a memorable password that
meets the specified criteria from the other password preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 10000.</p>
<p>There is normally no need to ever change this but, if you change it
and make it too small, <em>PAM</em> will report errors if it fails to
generate passwords after the maximum number of tries.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-prefix">Memorable Password Prefix</h4>
<p>The prefix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the
generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper
case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'A1!!/'</code> to
meet the criteria which might create passwords like
<code>'A1!!/html/wishes/combined'</code> or
<code>'A1!!/rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-suffix">Memorable Password Suffix</h4>
<p>The suffix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the
generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper
case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'/A1!!'</code> to
meet the criteria which might create passwords like
<code>'html/wishes/combined/A1!!'</code> or
<code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica/A1!!'</code>.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-preferences">Miscellaneous Preferences</h3>
<p>These are the preferences didn’t fall into the other categories.</p>
<h4 id="log-status-to-the-console">Log Status to the Console</h4>
<p>Log status messages to the console as well as the screen to aid
debugging.</p>
<p>The default is false which says do not log status messages to the
console.</p>
<p>You might want to enable console logging if you are debugging a
problem and are working in a browser that supports debugging.</p>
<h4 id="clear-records-on-load">Clear Records On Load</h4>
<p>Clear all records before loading records from a file.</p>
<p>The default is true which says to clear the records before a loading
new records from a file.</p>
<p>If you set this to false, another option titled <q>Load Duplicate
Record Strategy</q> will appear that is not normally visible to ask you
with strategy you want to used for conflicts.</p>
<p>You might set this preference to false if you want to to merge sets
of records from different files.</p>
<h4 id="load-duplicate-record-strategy">Load Duplicate Record
Strategy</h4>
<p>This preference is not visible unless the <q>Clear Records On
Load</q> preference is false.</p>
<p>It presents three strategies for handling duplicate records during a
load operation: <q>allow</q>, <q>ignore</q>, <q>replace</q>.</p>
<p>The <q>allow</q> strategy allows duplicate records to exist by
cloning them. For example if a record with the title <q>Google</q>
exists in the records and in the file being loaded, the record from the
file would be renamed to <q>Google Clone</q>.</p>
<p>The <q>ignore</q> strategy ignores the duplicate record that is being
loaded. If there is a conflict it prefers the one already present.</p>
<p>The <q>replace</q> strategy ignores the duplicate record that already
exists. If there is a conflict it prefers the record being loaded.</p>
<h4 id="clone-field-values-when-cloning-records">Clone Field Values when
Cloning Records</h4>
<p>This preference specifies that all data is kept when cloning a
record.</p>
<p>Remember that cloning a record is very simple and powerful way to
create records with the same fields but you have to delete the existing
values before entering new ones which is very simple.</p>
<p>The default is false which says to keep the field values when
cloning.</p>
<p>Set this preference if you want to avoid deleting the fields
manually.</p>
<h4 id="custom-about">Custom About</h4>
<p>Customized HTML that is added to the about page. It can be used in
cases where the field records have been customized to provide an
explanation or link to internal documentation.</p>
<h3 id="record-fields">Record Fields</h3>
<p>These are the pre-defined record fields that are used when creating
or editing record fields. They can be overridden.</p>
<p>At the top of the section there is
<img src="./plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="add"/> icon
that is used to create a new record field.</p>
<p>Each pre-defined record field has a name, a type (from a pulldown
menu) and a delete button
(<img src="./trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/>) that
you click to delete the record field.</p>
<p>The record field names must be unique.</p>
<h3 id="saving-preferences">Saving Preferences</h3>
<p>You <em>must</em> scroll to the bottom of the dialogue and click on
the <code>"Save"</code> button at the end to save changes. If you do
not, any changes you made will be lost.</p>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em>, like all web applications, has security challenges. By
fully disclosing them here you can understand the challenges and improve
your ability to protect your record data.</p>
<h3 id="mitm">MITM</h3>
<p>MITM refers to <q>Monster In The Middle</q> attacks or, historically,
<q>Man In The Middle</q> attacks. It an attack where a hostile
eavesdropper inserts themselves in the communications stream between a
client and a server to capture or alter the communications for nefarious
purposes like stealing credentials.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is not susceptible to this attack because it <em>does
not communicate with a server</em>. That is because it is a single page
web application that is downloaded and run within your browser. All data
is local. Nothing is ever transferred over the internet for an
eavesdropper to capture.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-web-site-security">Third Party Web Site
Security</h3>
<p>Third party web site security can be a major source of cybersecurity
vulnerabilities because clients cannot know how well such cybersecurity
vulnerabilities are mitigated unless that site publishes a detailed
report, on a periodic basis, of how often they were attacked
successfully and how many attacks they have successfully fended off.</p>
<p>Sadly, most companies do not provide that information. If you are
using a password manager or any other service that uses a server, you
might want to consider asking them how vulnerable they are to
cyberattacks. At a minimum, you will want to understand what is done to
protect your data from insider attacks where an employee steals the
data.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can get information about the security of a site by
looking at Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) reports. See <a
href="https://www.cve.org/">https://www.cve.org/</a> for more
information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor reporting of third party web site cybersecurity vulnerabilities
and exposures was one thing that motivated me to write <em>PAM</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because <em>PAM</em> does not send the data to a server, it is not
vulnerable to how cybersecurity is managed on the server by a third
party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is not sending data out by
monitoring outbound traffic from your system. <em>PAM</em> never sends
any outbound data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PAM</em> encryption and decryption operations are provided by and
run <em>inside</em> the <em>secure context</em> of the browser. This is
the same <em>secure context</em> used for accessing sites securely for
transactions, like your bank. In practice this means that you must
access <em>PAM</em> from an HTTPS site.</p>
<p>The safety and security of <em>secure context</em> operations is
taken very seriously by the internet standards organization and the
organizations that develop the major browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a>
and in <a href="#reason-6-secure-context-encryption">Reason 6: Secure
Context Encryption</a>.</p>
<h3 id="site-reliability">Site Reliability</h3>
<p>Although it is not an attack vector <em>per se</em>, site reliability
is another consideration when choosing a web application because a
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the site or a power
failure at the site could make it unusable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most modern web applications are built using commercial
cloud software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service
(IaaS) products from vendors like AWS, Azure and GCP so they tend to be
<em>very</em> reliable but it is still something to be aware of because
if the site or the gateway to the site goes down so does the web
application.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em>, is hosted and served from <em>github.io</em> which also
appears to be very reliable but if you are concerned, you can host it
wherever you like. Also <em>PAM</em> does not do any backend server
communication (as mentioned earlier) so it will like continue to run
even if the site goes down temporarily because, once it is loaded, it
will stay resident until you close the browser tab.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is where you store your <em>PAM</em> record
file(s). I use iCloud which is also quite reliable and allows access to
iCloud files directly from my computers, mobile devices and tablets.</p>
<p>Just make sure that whichever infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
offering you choose it is reliable as well because you don’t want to
lose access to your file because the IaaS service is not available.</p>
<p>Of course you could simply load and save the data to a local file but
that might restrict access to it from other devices (like mobile phones
or tables) and you would have to be very diligent about keeping it
backed up.</p>
<h3 id="over-the-shoulder-surfing-attack">Over the Shoulder Surfing
Attack</h3>
<p>The user enters the record data in decrypted form, so it may be
vulnerable to over the shoulder surfing attacks where someone or
something (like a camera) watches or films the user typing or opening a
record and then clicking or tapping on a password field to display the
password in plaintext which could allow that information to be
stolen.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be mitigated by being aware of your
surroundings to make sure you are not being watched or filmed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is different and easier to mitigate than <q>key-logging and
screen recording</q> as discussed in the next subsection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="malware-key-logging-and-screen-recording">Malware: Key Logging
and Screen Recording</h3>
<p>If malware that takes screenshots or does key logging has been
installed on your computer, phone or tablet, you are in trouble for a
variety of reasons. It means that an attacker can see what you are doing
and capture what you are typing.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate these forms of attacks is to keep your
system up to date by installing security patches and by using some sort
of security tool or tools to protect your system or, at the very least,
recognize the infection.</p>
<h3 id="malware-clipboard-attack">Malware: Clipboard Attack</h3>
<p>Yet another type of vulnerability is the <q>clipboard attack</q>
if/when data is copied to the clipboard for cut and paste operations.
This vulnerability exists because the clipboard is a global resource
that can be accessed by other, independent applications.</p>
<p>Clipboard attacks can be mitigated by making sure that your computer
does not have malware installed or by not copying to the clipboard.
Although it is probably impractical to not use the clipboard at all so,
if you do use the clipboard, make sure that you always reset it after
any copy/paste operation to minimize any chances that it will be
captured by malware or observed by an attacker. You can reset it by
simply selection a single letter or word and copying it.</p>
<p>Another, perhaps better, way to mitigate the clipboard vulnerability
<em>might</em> be to eliminate the need for the clipboard by modifying
<em>PAM</em> to automatically login in for you based on record data
using an HTTP POST operation but that is not currently available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I say <em>might</em> here, because I do not know how secure
POST operations are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="unattended-browser">Unattended Browser</h3>
<p>If you leave the browser unattended without locking your screen after
you have loaded your record data, someone can sit down and see the
records because they are impersonating you <em>after you have logged
in</em>.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate this attach is to always lock your screen
when you leave the computer unattended.</p>
<h3 id="website-spoofing">Website Spoofing</h3>
<p>Web site spoofing could be used to direct you to a website that could
be used to steal your information using a look alike web
application.</p>
<p>To mitigate that make sure that you accessing the <em>PAM</em> from a
known, trusted site.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about this, you can always download, build and
run <em>PAM</em> from your own trusted site.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>In summary, security can never be fully guaranteed, the best way to
protect your data is to follow commonly recommended security
practices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep all of your security patches up to date.</li>
<li>Keep malware off of your systems.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are not observed.</li>
<li>Never share sensitive information (like passwords).</li>
<li>Backup your data.</li>
<li>Use a strong password for encrypting your files.
<ol type="1">
<li>It should be at least 20 characters.</li>
<li>It should not contain personally identifiable information like
dates.</li>
<li>It should be memorable and fairly easy to type.</li>
<li>I suggest using a memorable password of length 30 or more that
contains 3 to 5 words with a custom prefix and suffix. Perhaps something
with a structure like this:
<q><code>A1/jeans/chosen/since/tuition?!!</code></q> (do NOT use this
specific password!).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Make sure that the website URL is what you expect.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multi-factor-authentication">Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Several folks have asked me why Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was
not included in <em>PAM</em> to provide and additional layer of
security.</p>
<p>In general the MFA approach assumes that the users identity must be
checked and validated (authentication) so that the site offering the
services knows that it is dealing with the valid user not an
impersonator <em>which is a great thing</em> but it is not necessary for
<em>PAM</em> because <em>PAM</em> has no <em>site</em>.</p>
<p>Instead <em>PAM</em> is a single page web application with <em>no
backend processing</em>, which, once it is loaded, makes it more like a
local word processor that is tailored to managing customized records in
<em>local</em> files so any additional communication over the internet
represents a risk as does storing any user information. Everything is
done inside the browser in a secure context.</p>
<p>No outbound information is ever sent to the internet unless the user
specifically requests it via the <code>"Load File"</code> and
<code>"Save File"</code> operations while using cloud storage but at
that point all data is encrypted both at the file level and as the HTTPS
transport level which is required for the browser secure context which,
in turn, is required by <em>PAM</em> to function which is pretty safe if
you protect your data with a strong password.</p>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is functioning securely by
monitoring outbound internet traffic. You should never see any outbound
traffic from <em>PAM</em> that is not related to the file load and save
operations.</p>
<p>For all of the above reasons, I felt the MFA would not improve
security and, hence, was not needed.</p>
<h2 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h2>
<p>The examples in this section talk about how to use this app under
different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="personal-account-records">Personal Account Records</h3>
<p>This is the most common usage. It is where personal account records
are stored so that you have a permanent, encrypted record of all of your
passwords.</p>
<h4 id="create-record-and-file">Create Record and File</h4>
<p>To create a file and a record follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app: <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/</a>.
<ul>
<li>This can be done from any device, like your phone, tablet or
computer but you must have access to cloud storage (on iphone and ipads
that would be iCloud).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select the <code>"New Record"</code> option from the menu in the
upper right hand corner.</li>
<li>When the new record dialogue pops up, enter the account name as the
title, an example might be <q>Google email</q>.</li>
<li>Add fields like <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q> and set
their values.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>At this point it will appear as your first record on the
display.</li>
<li>Now save it to a file by selecting <q>Save File</q> from the
menu.</li>
<li>Enter the file name, perhaps something like
<code>"mystuff.pam"</code> or <code>"joe.pam"</code> if your name is
<q>Joe</q> or <code>"account.pam"</code>.
<ul>
<li>I have found that some devices do not like the <code>".pam"</code>
file extension. I that is the case use the <code>".txt"</code> file
extension. Everything loves that and the data is guaranteed to be ASCII
text (even when encrypted).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enter a password.
<ol type="1">
<li>This is the password that you need to access all of the records in
the file.</li>
<li>The password is <em>not</em> stored so make sure that you keep track
of it somewhere because if it is lost, the records <em>cannot</em> be
retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your data is stored. You can add as many additional
records as you want or change existing records. As long as you save
them, they will be available to you.</p>
<h4 id="use-record-data-to-log-into-a-site">Use Record Data to Log into
a Site</h4>
<p>To use the data to log into a site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the <q>url</q> link so that the site opens up in a
different tab.</li>
<li>Enter the login name or email by clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the login name and paste into the site.</li>
<li>Enter the password by clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the password and paste into the site.
<ol type="1">
<li>You do <em>not</em> need to make the password visible to do
this.</li>
<li>It picks up the correct password even when it is hidden.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="edit-an-existing-record">Edit an Existing Record</h3>
<p>To edit an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the edit
<img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to make the necessary changes to the fields or
title.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="delete-an-existing-record">Delete an Existing Record</h4>
<p>To delete an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the delete
<img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="clone-an-existing-record">Clone an Existing Record</h4>
<p>This is a really powerful operation that allows you to quickly create
records with the same fields.</p>
<p>To clone a record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the edit
<img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to update the fields.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to disable the copying of field data turn off the
<q>Clone Field Values when Cloning Records</q> preference. That avoids
having to delete each old field value before typing in the new field
value.</p>
<h3 id="shared-credentials-for-a-small-group">Shared Credentials for a
Small Group</h3>
<p>This scenario assumes that a small group of trusted people wants to
share a common file of account records with credentials that can only be
decrypted using a single shared password that is only known to the
group.</p>
<p>This might be suitable for a <em>small</em> group that requires
administrative access to a <em>small</em> number of accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it involves sharing a password, this approach may be too
insecure for some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this approach is adopted, it would be wise to change the shared
password frequently, to audit all access to the shared file as well as
audit all access to the accounts. Also, since the shared file
<em>must</em> be on a mounted volume that can be seen by the input file
dialogue, access to the mount and, by extension, to the file can also be
restricted.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to share a <em>PAM</em>
file.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the mounted volume where the file will be located.</li>
<li>Create the pam file and populate it with the shared records.
<ul>
<li>Optionally, you may wish to limit the record fields to
<code>login</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>note</code> and
<code>host</code> by editing the preferences and removing the other
fields since all of the records have a specific, known format.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save the file to the mounted volume with a password.</li>
<li>Communicate the location of the file and the password to the members
of the group in a secure way.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recipes">Recipes</h3>
<p>This is a bit of contrived example because you could easily keep all
of your recipes with your other personal account data but it might be
useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>The key notion here is the idea of creating two new fields in the
preference dialogue: <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q>, and
then use them when you enter recipes.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to get the fields
defined.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the preferences dialogue from the menu.</li>
<li>Add the new fields by clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon
in the <code>"Record Fields"</code> in the preferences section.
<ol type="1">
<li><code>"ingredients"</code> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
<li><code>"instructions"</code> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete all of the other record fields defined in the preferences by
clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon
because there is no need for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search by an ingredient, set the <q>Search Record Field Values</q>
preference to true by clicking or tapping on it and then saving it.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>This is another somewhat of contrived example because you could
easily keep all of your book reviews with your other personal account
data but it might be useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>For my book reviews, I enter the book title as the record title and
added the following fields using the methodology described in the
recipes section above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I <em>only</em> add records for books that have been
read.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="developer-notes">Developer Notes</h2>
<p>These are things that developers might be interested in.</p>
<p>It was built using pure javascript and relies on the browser secure

<h3 id="build-pam">Build PAM</h3>
<p>Here are the steps to build PAM.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jlinoff/pam.git</code></li>
<li><code>make init</code>
<ul>
<li>This installs the python test infrastructure including pylenium as
well as bootstrap.</li>
<li>It also creates the <code>www/js/version.js</code> file and the
help.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make run</code>
<ul>
<li>Runs the python server on port 8081 so that you can access the app
locally from http://localhost:8081 in a secure context.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="test-pam">Test PAM</h3>
<p>Here are the steps to test PAM.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>make test</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The test infrastructure uses python and pylenium to automate user
interactions.</p>
<h3 id="release-pam">Release PAM</h3>
<p>Note that <em>PAM</em> will not work unless it is released to a
secure (HTTPS) server because it requires a <em>secure context</em>.</p>
<p>Note that installing it on local server (localhost or 127.0.0.1) is
considered secure which is convenient for personal use.</p>
<p>Here are the steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the <code>VERSION</code> file using semantic versioning.</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to propagate the new version and update
<code>README.md</code></li>
<li>Run <code>make web</code> to create <code>pam-www.tar</code> which
contains the app in <code>pam/www</code>.</li>
<li>Untar the <code>pam-www.tar</code> on your site.</li>
</ol>
<p>This pre-supposes that you have clone the pam project and have made
modifications.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>This is one of the several times that i have written a password
manager from scratch over the past twenty years and it is intended to be
the last. Because this version while it is <em>far</em> from perfect, is
good enough for my needs and should provide a decent start for someone
who wants to improve it.</p>

some of the problems seen in the earlier attempts and it leverages <a
href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a>
to make it work better in mobile browsers. The implementation is a bit
simpler but like all of the other attempts there is still plenty of room
for improvement.</p>
<p>The acronym stands for Personal Accounts Manager or Password Manager
or whatever. It doesn’t really matter. I just wanted something short and
easy to remember.</p>
<h4 id="chronology">Chronology</h4>
<p>I first wrote a password manager in the early 2000’s in javascript.
In those days I had to write my own uncertified implementations of the
encryption algorithms like AES-256-CBC and AES-256-GCM and DES3 but that
was perfectly okay because, back then, my day job involved a lot of
security stuff like designing hardware and software (in C++) to
implement certified algorithms.</p>
<p>As time went on, i would continue to re-implement password managers
as a hobby to learn new skills and refresh old ones. That pretty quickly
got me into javascript, python, docker, golang and, a few years ago, to
rust. It has been a fun journey and i learned a great deal.</p>
<p>By the time, i got around to writing <em>PAM</em>, i was using the
prototype for a lot more than password management (mostly because i
could enter records from my phone). It was a useful idiom for record
management in general which is where things are today.</p>
<p>You will see that i dropped Rust in the latest incarnation but that
is not because i don’t think Rust is suitable or wonderful. Rust is most
definitely suitable and wonderful. I dropped it because i did not need
it. The secure context had everything i needed.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, i would have done this in emacs
<code>org-mode</code> (yes, i am one of those) but i was never able to
get remote access from multiple devices working as well as i liked so i
stuck with javascript.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that there is something here that others can learn
something from it and have as much fun as i have had but, if not, it
doesn’t matter, i have really enjoyed playing around with this over the
years. The journey was worth it.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
