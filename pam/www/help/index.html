<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> or Personal Account Manager is a free and open source, single page web application that is designed to help you conveniently and securely manage your confidential information <em>like passwords</em> inside the secure context of your web browser as dynamically configurable records that can be searched <em>without having to rely on services from a third party server</em> because they are stored in a file that <em>you control</em> either on your local device or on a cloud based file server.</p>
<p>The <em>PAM</em> file is encrypted both in transit and when stored so the contents are safe from hackers if the file was stolen assuming, of course, that the password you used to encrypt it <em>was strong</em>.</p>
<p>The PAM file flow is shown in the figure below. Note that the <em>save</em> device and the <em>load</em> device could be <em>the same device</em>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-file-flow-screenshot.png" width="95%" alt="pam-file-flow"></p>
<p>You can access <em>PAM</em> from your own secure web server (including localhost) or from the public <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html">github.io server</a>. In either case, once the application is loaded into your browser <em>there is no other communication</em> with the web server which you can verify by monitoring outbound network traffic.</p>
<p>In addition, <em>PAM</em> is designed to be mobile friendly so you can access it from your laptop browser as well as your mobile phone and tablet.</p>
<p>It looks <em>something</em> like this on my iphone in dark mode for the fictitious example records that are provided by PAM to practice with, as described in the <a href="#load-file">Load File</a> section later on.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-iphone-screenshot-dark.jpg" alt="iphone-screenshot-light-mode" width="400"></p>
<p>And <em>something</em> like this in light mode.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-iphone-screenshot-light.jpg" alt="iphone-screenshot-dark-mode" width="400"></p>
<p>At the bottom left of the screen there is a button that allows you to toggle between light and dark mode. It looks like a sun (switch to light) in dark mode: <img src="../icons/black/sun.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> and like a moon (switch to dark) in light mode: <img src="../icons/black/moon.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/>.</p>
<p>Dark and light mode examples will be intermixed throughout this document.</p>
<p>The records appear as accordion entries that expand when you click on them as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-record.png" width="400" alt="google-account-example"></p>
<p>Once the record is expanded you simply click on the clipboard <img src="../icons/black/clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon associated with the record field you are interested in (like the password) to copy its value to the system clipboard so that it can then be pasted them into the appropriate login field. You can click on the eye <img src="../icons/black/eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon to see the password in plaintext. By default all record fields containing sensitive information,like passwords, are masked so that a casual observer cannot see it.</p>
<p>You can even include images as shown in this example which is also provided by PAM to practice with and, like the examples above, is also described in the <a href="#load-file">Load File</a> section later on.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae-open.png" width="400" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>There are other features like memorable password generation and customized record fields that are described in the documentation below.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not the first tool I have written to manage passwords but it is meant to be the last. If you are interested in what motivated me to create yet another tool, see the <em><a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a></em> and <em><a href="#reasons-to-consider-using-pam">Reasons to consider using PAM</a></em>. If you are interested in the genesis of <em>PAM</em> and the stories of its predecessors, see the <a href="#history">History</a> section.</p>
<p>I hope that you also find useful in some way.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a pretty simple application. It is basically a record editor that runs in your browser that allows you to create records with interesting information that can then be stored and retrieved in a secure way.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-not-use-pam">Reasons to not use PAM</h3>
<p>This section talks about why you may not need or want to use <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<h4 id="reason-1-do-not-need-it">Reason 1: Do Not Need It</h4>
<p>It is very reasonable to ask yourself why, if <em>PAM</em> is like an editor, you can’t simply just use something like an Excel spreadsheet or a text file editor or keep passwords on a sheet of paper or use one of the many commercially available password managers?</p>
<p>That is an excellent question. The answer is that you <em>can</em> and, if you are already using an Excel spreadsheet or a text file editor or a sheet of paper or a password management service or any other method that works for you, <em>you should</em>.</p>
<h4 id="reason-2-too-complex">Reason 2: Too Complex</h4>
<p>Even if you do not already have a method for managing passwords <em>PAM</em> may not be the right choice. <em>PAM</em> requires that you understand a bit about HTML input and textarea elements which may be confusing. Also the <em>PAM</em> user interface (UI) and record data model may be confusing or hard to understand and use because I am not a UI programmer.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I wrote <em>PAM</em> to provide some features I wanted and to address some concerns I had with existing approaches. Those features and concerns are discussed in the next section to help you understand my reasoning so that you can decide whether any of them are important to you. If you don’t care about the features and the concerns that bother me, there is no reason to use this tool.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-consider-using-pam">Reasons to consider using PAM</h3>
<p>This section presents the nine primary reasons that motivated me to develop <em>PAM</em>. They are provided to to help you determine whether <em>PAM</em> might be interesting to you.</p>
<h4 id="reason-1-no-client-server-communications">Reason 1: No Client Server Communications</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a single page web application (SPA) that has no backend which means that it never communicates with an external site which protects it from some types of cyber attacks as detailed in the <a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</h4>
<p>In <em>PAM</em>, information is organized into files composed of records that each have a unique title and are, in turn, composed of fields that have a name, a type and a value. This approach is similar to organizing information using index cards or a rolodex.</p>
<p>Following the index card analogy a little further, we can use a simple example to understand the record model a bit better.</p>
<p>A recipe would be something you might store on an index card. Each recipe could be a single record that might contain the <em>title</em> (the name of the recipe), the <em>ingredients</em> (a field) and the <em>instructions</em> (another field).</p>
<h5 id="simple-recipe-record">Simple Recipe Record</h5>
<p>So what would a simple dessert recipe look like as a in <em>PAM</em> record? Well, if you had a simple dessert recipe like this written on a card with an attached picture.</p>
<blockquote style="border: 1px black solid; width: 32ch">
<p><img src="./ice-cream-sundae.jpg" width="200" alt="ice-cream-sundae"></p>
<pre><code>Ice Cream Sundae

ingredients
1. 3 scoops vanilla ice cream
2. 1 banana (sliced up)
3. chocolate sauce
4. (optional) nuts
5. (optional) Maraschino cherry
6. whipped cream

instructions
1. put ice cream in bowl
2. add slices of banana
3. add nutes
4. pour chocolate on top
5. add whip cream
6. put the cherry on top.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It would look like this when you <em>create</em> it in <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae-new.png" width="400" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>It would look like this when you <em>view</em> it in <em>PAM</em> in edit mode.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae-open.png" width="400" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>In this <em><q>recipe</q></em> record, the title is <code>"Ice Cream Sundae"</code> and the two fields <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> contain the multiline (<code>textarea</code>) descriptions of what the ingredients and instructions are for this specific recipe. And, finally, there is an <q>html</q> field that contains the image.</p>
<p>Note that the record field names <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> used in this example are custom <em>field names</em>. They are not available by default. The <q>html</q> field <em>is</em> a default field.</p>
<p>Custom fields can be created by adding new fields to the default fields defined in the preferences so they are available all of the time.</p>
<p>For this example I created two new <em>textarea</em> fields named <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> so that users could enter multiple lines and removed all of the other default fields except the <q>html</q> field because they were not needed. I kept the default <q>html</q> field because I wanted to be able add pictures to the recipes. Here is what the preferences look like after the modifications were made.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-recipe-prefs.png" width="400" alt="default"/></p>
<h5 id="simple-account-record">Simple Account Record</h5>
<p>Of course, there are many other types of records that might be interesting to store in <em>PAM</em> that can use the default record fields <em>as is</em>. See the <a href="#fields">Fields</a> section for a description of the default records and their types.</p>
<p>One common one is a record for each account that you need to login into where you information about how to login is stored so you don’t have to remember it.</p>
<p>Such an <em><q>account</q></em> record would have, at a minimum, the web address (URL), the login name and the password of the account.</p>
<p>Note that this simplified example is only meant to show the basic idea of importance of supporting record formats that are different than recipes. For a real account record you would probably want to add additional fields like an email address or a notes field.</p>
<p>Here is what the simple account record would look like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-account.png" width="400" alt="google-account-example"></p>
<p>Note that the password is hidden in the example above. <em>PAM</em> always hides the contents of passwords by default.</p>
<h5 id="record-model-summary">Record Model Summary</h5>
<p>Both records look quite different. Recipes records have fields for <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> whereas account records have fields for the <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>. However, in both cases they have the same basic structure: a title and a set of fields that are relevant to recipes or accounts.</p>
<p>You could easily imagine defining other records that contain information for other topics like <em><q>books read</q></em> or <em><q>unidentified aerial phenomena</q></em> or <em><q>bird watching</q></em> which would undoubtedly require different fields. The idea of topics is dicussed in more detail in the <a href="#topics">Topics</a> section.</p>
<p>In my view, this approach of using <em>records composed of fields</em> does a better job of representing this type of information than a spreadsheet or a text file.</p>
<h4 id="reason-3-searching">Reason 3: Searching</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> allows you to search records by their title or their field names and values. It also filters out the records that don’t match to make it easier to see the matching records visually.</p>
<p>The availability of fast interactive searching makes finding records easy.</p>
<p>This is what search/filtering looks like for all example records that contain a <q>g</q> in them. Note that, by default, search operations are case insensitive but that can be changed in the preferences.</p>

<h4 id="reason-4-automatic-password-generation">Reason 4: Automatic Password Generation</h4>
<p>I always find it hard to come up with passwords in the spur of the moment so <em>PAM</em> was built with the ability to automatically generate passwords.</p>
<p>Of course almost all browsers and password tools provide this same capability nowadays, but they tend to generate secure, cryptic, hard to memorize passwords which is perfectly fine for passwords for most accounts.</p>
<p>But there are a cases when you need a password that must be typed in manually like the login password for a computer that does not use biometric scanning or a key FOB. In those cases it is beneficial to have a password that is secure, easy to remember and easy to type because you cannot access a password management system <em>before you login</em>.</p>
<p>I call passwords of this type <em>memorable</em> passwords. They are composed of common lower case English words with an optional prefix, an optional separator between each word and an optional suffix.</p>
<p>Often, the prefix and suffix are used to guarantee that the password contains the correct mix of characters that the authentication system requires, like, at least one capital letter, at least one digit and at least one special character.</p>
<p>To make these concepts a bit clearer, here are examples of a cryptic and a memorable password.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><!-- --></th>
<th><!-- --></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td><code>Rf5NaR7LH2LbZMRhkPCfeG8</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>memorable</td>
<td><code>A1/health/mpegs/hopes!!</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this example, the memorable password word separator is <code>"/"</code>, the prefix is <code>"A1/"</code> (capital letter and digit) and the suffix is <code>"!!"</code> (special characters).</p>
<p>To help with this, <em>PAM</em> was built with the ability to generate <em>cryptic</em> and <em>memorable</em> passwords.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about password generation in <em>PAM</em> see the <a href="#password-fields">Password Fields</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="reason-5-file-based-storage">Reason 5: File Based Storage</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> uses files to load and store the record data.</p>
<p>Using a file means that the user does not have to rely on the cybersecurity infrastructure of a company running a web server and storing your data at their site or another third party site. This was alluded in <a href="#reason-1-no-client-server-communications">Reason 1: No Client Server Communications</a> but that is not the <em>only</em> advantage of using files.</p>
<p>A <em>PAM</em> file is composed of a set of records. Any records you like. You can use a single file for all of your records or you can have multiple files where each file contains records that are somehow related like records of <em><q>recipes</q></em> or <em><q>book reviews</q></em> or <em><q>my favorite species of Euglena</q></em>.</p>
<p>What this means is that you can group records associated by a topic in different files to make them easier to organize and find. This ability to organize files around topics is the other reason that I prefer the file based storage model.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion about how the user controls the organization of the records and fields in a file see the <a href="#reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</a> section of this document.</p>
<p>As a side note, I store my personal <em>PAM</em> record files in <em>Apple iCloud</em> which is one of many cloud based storage services like <em>Dropbox</em>, <em>Google Drive</em> and <em>Microsoft OneDrive</em>.</p>
<p>For files I want to share with other folks, I use <em>Google Drive</em> to store the file and then share it.</p>
<p>When properly configured all of these storage services store the <em>PAM</em> record file in the cloud so that it is available to anyone who knows the file password as long as their laptop, phone or tablet is authorized to access the storage service.</p>
<p>Of course you could simply load and save the data to a local file but that <em>might</em> restrict your ability to access to it from other devices (like mobile phones or tables). Not only that but you would have to be very diligent about keeping it backed up so that you would not lose data if the local file was corrupted or lost.</p>
<h4 id="reason-6-secure-context-encryption">Reason 6: Secure Context Encryption</h4>
<p>When records are stored in a <em>PAM</em> file they can be encrypted using a password. The password is then used by an <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program"><em>NIST certified</em></a>, symmetric encryption algorithm: <code>AES-256-CBC</code> to encode the records.</p>
<p>Using a certified encryption algorithm provides a strong security guarantee which means, that if an encrypted <em>PAM</em> file is stolen, the record data is considered safe from hackers trying to crack the contents <em>if a strong password was used</em>.</p>
<p>Passwords like <em><q>secret</q></em> or <em><q>password123</q></em> or any other password that can be found in freely available password dictionaries like the <a href="https://kalitut.com/best-password-dictionary/#Kali_password_dictionary">Kali password dictionary</a> are <em>not</em> strong and will <em>not</em> protect your data because they are easy to guess.</p>
<p><em>Always</em> use a strong password to make it hard to guess. Typically a strong password would have at least 20 characters would not include any personally identifiable information (PII) like your name, birth date or address. Also <em>never, ever</em> use the same password for two different sites. This is to protect you from hackers if a site you use to is attacked and your password is stolen.</p>
<p>I recommend reading <a href="https://www.auditboard.com/blog/nist-password-guidelines/">NIST Password Guidelines</a> for more information about how to create strong passwords.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, note that <code>AES-256-CBC</code> algorithm is considered to be reasonably resistant to quantum attacks as discussed in the literature. For example, <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6712/is-aes-256-a-post-quantum-secure-cipher-or-not">here</a> is one relevant exchange from a <code>crypto.stackexchange.com</code> discussion.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> encryption and decryption operations are provided by and run <em>inside</em> the <em>secure context</em> of the browser. This is the same <em>secure context</em> used for accessing sites securely for transactions, like your bank. In practice this means that you must access <em>PAM</em> from an HTTPS site.</p>
<p>The safety and security of <em>secure context</em> operations is taken very seriously by the internet standards organization and the organizations that develop the major browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="reason-7-hiding-passwords-from-casual-observers">Reason 7: Hiding Passwords from Casual Observers</h4>
<p>Passwords and other secrets are automatically hidden on the screen (displayed as asterisks) so that someone looking over your shoulder cannot read them unless you choose to make them visible. You can read more about why this is beneficial in the <a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a> section.</p>
<p>This is the default hidden view of a password. You can see that the password value is all <em>asterisks</em>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-hidden.png" width="400" alt="password-hidden"></p>
<p>This is the same view of a password when it is not hidden. You can now see the password value.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-shown.png" width="400" alt="password-shown"></p>
<h4 id="reason-8-access-from-mobile-devices">Reason 8: Access from mobile devices</h4>
<p>The record files can be accessed from mobile devices so the user has access to the records anywhere as described in the <a href="#reason-5-file-based-storage">Reason 5: File Based Storage</a> but that does not necessarily imply that the interface is <em>mobile friendly</em>.</p>
<p>What makes <em>PAM</em> mobile friendly is that it is implemented using the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a> library to make the interface work better in the browsers present on mobile devices.</p>
<h4 id="reason-9-foss">Reason 9: FOSS</h4>
<p>Last but not least, one compelling reason to try <em>PAM</em> is that it is free and open source software (FOSS) so you can try it without any obligation or cost. You can also help find and fix bugs or improve the UI.</p>
<h2 id="records">Records</h2>
<p>Records composed of fields are a key concept in <em>PAM</em> as described in <a href="#reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</a>.</p>
<p>This section talks about how records are presented in <em>PAM</em> using an example with seven records that contain confidential information for <q>Amazon</q>, <q>Email</q>, <q>Facebook</q>, <q>Github</q>, <q>Google</q>, <q>Netflix</q> and <q>Stack Exchange</q> fictional accounts from the <a href="#load-file">Load File</a> example.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#create-new-record">Create New Record</a> section for details about how to create records and the <a href="#topics">Topics</a> and <a href="#fields">Fields</a> sections for more details about their contents.</p>
<h3 id="unexpanded-view-of-all-records">Unexpanded View of all Records</h3>
<p>We start with the unexpanded view of all records as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-example-records.png" width="400" alt="example-records"></p>
<p><em>PAM</em> presents the records as an accordion. Each record is one entry in the accordion that you can expand to view the record fields or <a href="#delete-record">delete</a>, <a href="#clone-record">clone</a> or <a href="#edit-record">edit</a> edit the record.</p>
<p>To get the information for an account you click or tap the button.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status messages.</p>
<h3 id="expanded-view-of-a-record">Expanded View of a Record</h3>
<p>Once you click on or tap a record it expands as shown below where the <q>Facebook</q> record was tapped.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can see that there are three fields in the record: <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>, next to each field there is a icon that looks like a clipboard <img src="../icons/black/clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>If you click or tap the clipboard icon, the field contents will be copied to the clipboard so that you can paste them into a login dialogue.</p>
<p>In addition to the clipboard icon there is another icon that looks like an eye <img src="../icons/black/eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> that shows up for password field. If you click or tap it, the password will be shown in plaintext and the icon will change to an eye with a slash through it <img src="../icons/black/eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye-slash"/>. By default all passwords are hidden so that they are not visible to casual observers. Click or tap it again to re-hide the password. Passwords are correctly copied to the clipboard at all times even when the password is hidden.</p>
<p>In addition there are three buttons at the bottom <q><img src="../icons/black/trash.svg" height='32' width='32' alt='trash'/> Delete</q> to delete the record, <q><img src="../icons/black/files.svg" height='32' width='32' alt='files' /> Clone</q> to clone the record and <q><img src="../icons/black/pencil-square.svg" height='32' width='32' alt='pencil-square'/> Edit</q> to edit the record fields.</p>
<p>As shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields2.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>The fields <em>in</em> records are completely customizable when you select the <code>"Edit"</code> option.</p>
<p>Fields are added <em>to</em> the record by selecting a new field from the <code>"New Record"</code> drop down menu as shown below for the <code>"Facebook"</code> record but these fields can <em>also</em> be changed. See the <a href="#custom-fields">Custom Fields</a> and <a href="#field-types">Field Types</a> sections for details.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-edit-facebook-new-field.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>Fields are modified <em>in</em> the record by editing them directly and they are deleted <em>from</em> the record by clicking on the <img src="../icons/black/trash.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-edit-facebook.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<p>Topics define how records are related. They provide a convenient abstraction for organizing related records in files. Topics are completely arbitrary. For example a topic could be something like <em><q>recipes</q></em> or <em><q>accounts</q></em> or <em><q>unidentified aerial phenomena</q></em> or <em><q>my favorite cryptography algorithms</q></em> or <em><q>green things</q></em>.</p>
<p>One way to use topics is to keep records related by a topic in separate files. For example, you could define a <q><code>recipes.txt</code></q> file for all of your recipe records (topic: <em><q>recipes</q></em> or <em><q>stuff to cook</q></em>) and an <q><code>accounts.txt</code></q> for your account records (topic: <em><q>accounts</q></em>).</p>
<p>Or, you could completely disregard organizing by topics and put all of your records into a single file like <q><code>myrecords.txt</code></q>.</p>
<p>Note the use of the <q><code>.txt</code></q> extension in the previous paragraphs. Although the <q><code>.pam</code></q> file extension is supported for record files and it works on laptops. It does not always work on mobile devices so a records file named <q><code>myrecords.pam</code></q> might not be readable by the mobile browser. Thus, I recommend using the <q><code>.txt</code></q> for all record files for maximum portability.</p>
<h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>
<p>Records are composed of fields. Each field has a unique name, a type and a value.</p>
<p>The field <em>name</em> is arbitrary and is meant to describes how the data in the field is used. For example, an <q>ingredients</q> field would indicate that the value is a list of ingredients and a <q>number</q> field would indicate that the value is a number. An example of a field <em>name</em> might be <q>mobile phone</q>.</p>
<p>The field <em>type</em> explicitly describes the type of data that field holds like a <q>number</q> or a <q>phone</q> or an <q>email</q>. Types are built in and strictly enforced by javascript.</p>
<p>An example of the difference between a <em>name</em> and a <em>type</em> would be a field named <q>mobile</q> of type <em>phone</em>. The name describes <em>how</em> it is used whereas the type describes <em>what</em> the input type is which, in turn, dictates what user inputs are acceptable. A description of each built in record field type can be found in the <a href="#field-types">Field Types</a> section.</p>
<p>The field <em>value</em> is the unique value for the field in an individual record that is set when a field is created or edited. For example, an field named <q>email</q> of type <q>email</q> could have a value <q>wombat@foo.io</q> the <em>name</em> and the <em>type</em> could be the same for all records that had an <q>email</q> field but the <em>value</em> would vary.</p>
<p>The default record fields are the fields that are available in the <code>"New Field"</code> pull down menu when a record is created or edited. They are defined in the <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> section and they are stored in each records <em>file</em> along with the records so each records file can have different default fields.</p>
<p>For example a file of recipe records would probably want fields of type <em><q>textarea</q></em> named <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> but a file of <em><q>books read</q></em> records probably would not. Instead it might want <em><q>text</q></em> fields named <q>author</q> and <q>publisher</q> along with, possibly, a field of type <em><q>number</q></em> named <q>copyright</q>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#record-fields">Record Fields</a> section for details about how to add or modify the default record fields in the preferences dialogue.</p>
<p>There is a second more obscure way to define field names. You can change field names <em>when you create or edit an individual record</em> by setting the <a href="#enable-editable-field-name">Enable Editable Field Name</a> preference.</p>
<p>This capability is <em>not</em> enabled by default to avoid confusion between the <q>name</q> input and the <q>value</q> input as shown below. Normally only the <q>value</q> input is shown.</p>
<p>Typically there is no reason to change record field names on a per record basis. It is better to add the new record fields to the default list in the preferences.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-change-field-name.png" width="400" alt="change-field-name"></p>
<h3 id="field-types">Field Types</h3>
<p>Record field types define the type of each field that you define for a record. They are based on HTML <em>input</em> element types except for the <em><q>textarea</q></em> type which is a HTML <em>textarea</em> element that is displayed as <em>preformatted</em> text (&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;) and the <em><q>html</q></em> type which is also a HTML <em>textarea</em> type but is displayed as raw HTML so it can be used for inserting images. They are presented below as simple types regardless of the underlying HTML element to avoid unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>You can change, add or delete record field <em>names</em> here if you wish to customize the user experience but you cannot change the built in <em>types</em>. For example, you change the record field name <em><q>note</q></em> from a <em><q>textarea</q></em> field to a <em><q>text</q></em> but there is no way to add a new built in type to the drop down list from the user interface.</p>
<p>These are the default field definitions.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-default-record-fields.png" width="400" alt="default"/></p>
<p>The table below presents a brief overview of the default record fields and their associated built in types and when to use them. You can search the web for more details about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types">HTML input types</a>.</p>

<h3 id="custom-fields">Custom Fields</h3>
<p>It is oftentimes the case that all of the <em>default</em> record fields are not needed for the records you are managing or you may want to define new, custom fields that are more intuitive for your records. This section shows you how to do that.</p>
<p>Here is an example that shows a recipe record with <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> fields.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae-open.png" width="400" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>Here is what the preferences look like after <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> record fields have been added and the previous default record fields other than <em><q>html</q></em> have been pruned out.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-recipe-prefs.png" width="400" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example-prefs"></p>
<p>Here is an example that shows an account record with <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q> record fields.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-account.png" width="400" alt="google-account-example"></p>
<p>Here is what the preferences look like with the other fields pruned out. The <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q> record fields are part of the default.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-account-prefs.png" width="400" alt="google-account-example-prefs"></p>
<p>This is what they will look like in the <code>"New Record"</code> pull down menu when creating or editing a record.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-field-1-select.png" width="400" alt="new-record-field-1-select"></p>
<h2 id="password-fields">Password Fields</h2>
<p>Password fields are a special case for the following three reasons.</p>
<p>First, they provide a generator that allows you to automatically create passwords at the click or tap of a button. For information about preferences that can be used to customize password generation see <a href="#password-preferences">Password Preferences</a></p>
<p>Second, they always hide the value by default so that it can be seen by someone observing your screen.</p>
<p>And, finally, because they provide the ability to generate two different types of passwords: cryptic and memorable.</p>
<h3 id="cryptic-passwords">Cryptic Passwords</h3>
<p>Cryptic passwords consist of letters, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <code>'N5yAb!XfGa3vELPsK95K4/AAz8mts'</code>.</p>
<p>Cryptic passwords tend to be hard to memorize for most people.</p>
<p>They are perfect for cases where you don’t have to type the password in because they are hard to crack.</p>
<h3 id="memorable-passwords">Memorable Passwords</h3>
<p>Memorable passwords are used to define passwords that must be typed in manually, as described in the <a href="#reason-4-automatic-password-generation">Reason 4: Automatic Password Generation</a> section which means that it is important that they are secure, easy to type and to remember.</p>
<p>They are composed of common lower case English words with an optional prefix, an optional separator between each word and an optional suffix. Often, the prefix and suffix are used to guarantee that the password contains the correct mix of characters that the authentication system requires, like, at least one capital letter, at least one digit and at least one special character.</p>
<p>The security rationale for memorable passwords is described in this article: <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/the-logic-behind-three-random-words">The logic behind three random words</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <code>'Z0/rebates/restructuring/jamaica??'</code> where the prefix is <code>'Z0/'</code>, the separator is <code>'/'</code> and the suffix is <code>'??'</code>.</p>
<p>Memorable passwords tend to be easier to memorize than cryptic passwords for most people.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-password-representation">Hidden Password Representation</h3>
<p>Here is an example that shows a password in its standard hidden form.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>To make the password visible, click or tap on the <img src="../icons/black/eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon.</p>
<p>The password can be copied to the clipboard when it is hidden by clicking on the <img src="../icons/black/clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon.</p>
<h3 id="visible-password-representation">Visible Password Representation</h3>
<p>Here is an example that shows a password in its visible hidden form.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-password.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded-password"></p>
<p>The password can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on the <img src="../icons/black/clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon.</p>
<p>To hide the password, click or tap on the <img src="../icons/black/eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon.</p>
<h3 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h3>
<p>This is what the password field dialogue looks like with no generator.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-no-generator.png" width="400" alt="password-no-generator"></p>
<p>When you click or tap on the <img src="../icons/black/gear.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon, cryptic and memorable passwords are generated and the password generator dialogue appears.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-generator.png" width="400" alt="password-generator"></p>
<p>It always generates five memorable passwords to provide choices. I found that more useful than the original implementation which only had a single choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to present five memorable passwords was completely arbitrary but it seems to work well enough for my needs and can easily be changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the password generator looks like with annotations.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-generator-annotated.png" width="400" alt="password-generator-annotated"></p>
<p>If you click or tap on the <img src="../icons/black/gear.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon a second time, new passwords will be generated.</p>
<p>You must click or tap on the <img src="../icons/black/x-circle.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon to close the dialogue.</p>
<p>I chose this approach because I wanted the <img src="../icons/black/gear.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon to be used to generate new passwords.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, that choice may not have been the most intuitive way to implement closing the generator dialogue it but it works well enough and can easily be changed if it turns out to be too cumbersome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To choose a generated password simply click or tap on it and it will be added to the field value.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#password-preferences">Password Preferences</a> section about how to define the prefix and suffixes for memorable passwords.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a simple single page web application (SPA). It consists of three basic parts: the menu and search section, the records section and the status section.</p>
<p>It looks something like this</p>
<p><img src="./pam-basic-sections.png" width="400" alt="menu-bar"></p>
<h3 id="menu-and-search-section">Menu and Search Section</h3>
<p>The top section that contains a search input and a menu.</p>
<h4 id="search">Search</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> allows you to search records by their title or their field names and values to filter out records that do not match the search pattern. This is extremely useful when the number of records grows.</p>
<p>The search function at the top left supports case insensitive searches and regular expressions to make it easier to find records.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful for finding out where old passwords and obsolete accounts are still being used.</p>
<p>Here is the made up list of account records from the <a href="#load-files">Load Files</a> example:</p>
<p><img src="./pam-search.png" width="400" alt="pam-search"></p>
<p>Here is the same list after filtering for those whose titles contain the letter <code>"g"</code>. Note that searches are case insensitive but you can change that by unsetting the <a href="#case-insensitive-searches">Case Insensitive Searches</a> preference.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-search-g.png" width="400" alt="pam-search-g"></p>
<p>To filter only those that start with <code>"g"</code> you would use this regular expression search term instead: <code>"^g"</code>. which would result in only two records found.</p>
<p>For more information about regular expression syntax see the documentation for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">Javascript Regular Expressions</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about how you control the all of the available search options see the <a href="#search-preferences">Search Preferences</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="menu">Menu</h4>
<p>The menu at the top right is the control center for the application it has a number of options as you can see below. This is what it looks like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-menu.png" width="400" alt="menu"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are seven menu options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
<li><a href="#preferences">Preferences</a></li>
<li><a href="#create-new-record">New Record</a></li>
<li><a href="#clear-records">Clear Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#load-file">Load File</a></li>
<li><a href="#save-file">Save File</a></li>
<li><a href="#get-help">Help</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/info-circle.svg" height='32' width='32' /> About</q> entry to see information about the app. See the <a href="#about">About</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/gear.svg" height=' 32' width='32' /> Preferences</q> entry to see the preferences dialogue which allows you to customize some of the app behavior. There is a lot of stuff so you might want to read the <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> section before trying it.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/plus-circle-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> New Record</q> entry to create a new record. See the <a href="#create-new-record">Create New Record</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/trash3-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Clear Records</q> entry to delete all of the records. This is useful for times when you want to create a new collection of records that is saved in a separate file. For example, if you wanted to create a collection personal accounts in one file and a collection shared accounts for a group of folks (like a development team sharing AWS accounts).</p>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/file-arrow-up-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Load File</q> entry to load a records file. See the <a href="#load-file">Load File</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/file-arrow-down-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Save File</q> entry to save all of the records to a file. See the <a href="#save-file">Save File</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the <q><img src="../icons/black/question-circle.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Help</q> entry to see this help message.</p>
<h3 id="records-section">Records Section</h3>
<p>Underneath the top level bar, in the middle, is the records section. Each record is shown as an entry that is displayed by its title. If you click or tap on the record title, the record will expand to show the record contents (fields) and provide options for deleting, cloning or editing the record contents.</p>
<p>This way of presenting the records is called an accordion display. Below you can see how it expands after the <q>Facebook</q> entry has been selected.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>The expanded <q>Facebook</q> record has three fields: <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can copy the field values to the clipboard so that they can be pasted into login forms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the copy works for passwords whether the password is visible or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields2.png" width="400" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can also click or tap on the title of the opened record to close it.</p>
<p>Each of the record management options is discussed in more detail in the <a href="#functions">Functions</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="status-section">Status Section</h3>
<p>Below the records section, at the bottom, is the status section where ephemeral status messages are displayed. The messages disappear after about 1.5 seconds but the duration is controlled by a preference that you can set. See the <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>The status messages are used to provide activity feedback like showing how many bytes were copied to a clipboard when a copy button is clicked or tapped as shown in the example below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-status-msg.png" width="400" alt="status-message"></p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>The following sections will go over the basic functions that <em>PAM</em> provides.</p>
<p>In a nutshell they are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="#about">Display information About the application</a></li>
<li><a href="#create-new-record">Create New Record</a></li>
<li><a href="#edit-record">Edit Record</a></li>
<li><a href="#delete-record">Delete Record</a></li>
<li><a href="#clone-record">Clone Record</a></li>
<li><a href="#clear-records">Clear Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#save-records">Save Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#load-records">Load Records</a></li>
<li><a href="#get-help">Help</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each function will be discussed in a separate subsection below.</p>
<p>Note that Preferences were not included because they have their own top level section in this document.</p>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Click or tap on the <q>About</q> menu entry to get information about <em>PAM</em>. You can even add custom HTML through the preferences that is stored for each <em>PAM</em> file.</p>
<p>Here is a screen shot of what you would see.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about.png" width="400" alt="about"></p>
<p>Here is an about dialogue with a simple custom message.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-custom.png" width="400" alt="about-custom"></p>
<p>Custom messages are defined in preferences as follows.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-custom-pref.png" width="400" alt="about-custom-pref"></p>
<p>The motivation for allowing custom messages is that someone might want to share a <em>PAM</em> file or describe how the records are related. The custom message would allow the person to provide their <em>imprimatur</em> on the collection.</p>
<h3 id="create-new-record">Create New Record</h3>
<p>Before reading this section, please make sure that you are familiar with the ideas covered in the <a href="#topics">Topics</a>, <a href="#fields">Fields</a> and <a href="#password-fieldds">Password Fields</a> sections.</p>
<p>Creating a new record is a very common activity in <em>PAM</em> so I tried to make it as easy as possible.</p>
<p>There are three different methods you can use to create new records:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A record can be created in the application by clicking or tapping the <q>New Record</q> menu option,</li>
<li>A record can be created in the application by cloning an existing record or</li>
<li>A record can be created outside of the application by editing a JSON record file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each method is discussed in detail in the following subsections.</p>
<h4 id="method-1-menu-approach">Method 1: Menu Approach</h4>
<p>The first method, creating the record by clicking or tapping the <q>New Record</q> menu option in the application, is probably the best way to create the first new record for a topic family. This is also known as the <q>menu</q> approach and is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-create-new-record.png" width="400" alt="new-rec"></p>
<p>To show how it works, we will create a recipe record using <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instruction</q> fields. But first we need to define them as default <em><q>textarea</q></em> fields in the <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> dialogue. So the available records look like this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-recipe-prefs.png" width="400" alt="default"/></p>
<p>To create a new record using the menu approach click or tap on the <code>"New Record"</code> option from the menu.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-menu.png" width="400" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>That will popup a dialogue that looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record.png" width="400" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>You can now type in the record title.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-title.png" width="400" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>From there you click or tap on the <code>"New Field"</code> pulldown to select and create the first record field. Don’t worry if you select the wrong one, they are easy to delete.</p>
<p>Here is where you select <q>ingredients</q> for the first field.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-field-1-select.png" width="400" alt="new-record-field-1-select"></p>
<p>Populate it by typing into the <em><q>textarea</q></em> box.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-field-1.png" width="400" alt="new-record-field-1"></p>
<p>Now do the same thing to create an <q>instructions</q> field.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-field-2.png" width="400" alt="new-record-field-2"></p>
<p>One interesting thing to understand is that you can <em>change the order of the fields</em> by dragging them up or down. To do that select the field title at the top of the box (fieldset) and move it. This can also be done when editing the record.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like when I dragged the <q>instructions</q> field up.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-drag.png" width="400" alt="new-record-drag"></p>
<p>I then dragged <q>instructions</q> field back down because it should appear after <q>ingredients</q> field.</p>
<p>When you are finished click or tap on the <code>"Save"</code> button to save it and you will see it show up as a new record in the records part of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-done.png" width="400" alt="new-record-done"></p>
<p>You can click or tap on the record to expand it and see the fields you just defined.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-done-expand.png" width="400" alt="new-record-done-expand"></p>
<h4 id="method-2-clone-approach">Method 2: Clone Approach</h4>
<p>The second method, creating a record by cloning an existing record, is useful when you want to use the same fields as the existing record. It is a great way to guarantee uniformity. Although if the number of fields is small using the first method is also fine. Here is what the clone option looks like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-clone-google.png" width="400" alt="clone-rec"></p>
<p>Cloning a record is simple. Just expand a record and click or tap on the clone button and an edit dialogue pops up.</p>
<p>Using the record that was created in the previous section here is what happens when you click or tap the <code>"Clone"</code> button.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-clone-record-popup.png" width="400" alt="clone-record-popup"></p>
<p>The clone operation created a new record with a slightly modified title <q>Ice Cream Sundae Clone</q> <em>because the record title must be unique</em> and the same fields as the original record.</p>
<p>At this point you would typically change the title and field values but for this demonstration will not do anything. <em>PAM</em> makes sure that the title is unique so it can be saved.</p>
<p>Click or tap the <code>"Save"</code> button and you will see this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-clone-records-1.png" width="400" alt="clone-records-1"></p>
<p><em>PAM</em> still remembers that you had the original record open. Just below it you will see the new cloned record.</p>
<p>The reason that the original record is left open is so that it is easy to continue clicking or tapping the <code>"Clone"</code> button to create more records.</p>
<p>In this case we only care about one record so you can click or tap on the new record to expand it.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-clone-records-2.png" width="400" alt="clone-records-1"></p>
<h4 id="method-3-json-approach">Method 3: JSON Approach</h4>
<p>The third method, creating a record by editing a JSON record file, is most useful if you are interested in creating records programmatically (perhaps a subset of accounts that shared with a small group of users that is automatically generated from a database). The example records and recipes example files that are available in the <q>Load</q> dialogue are a great place to start.</p>
<p>This approach does not have any screenshots because it deals with <em>PAM</em> internals and may change from time to time. Instead a set of instructions is provided that should allows you to figure it out pretty easily.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create one record using the menu approach or use one the examples from the <q>Load</q> dialogue.</li>
<li>Save the record to a file <em>without a password</em>. Normally this is a very bad idea because it could expose your data to a hacker so take precautions to protect the file.</li>
<li>Look at the <q>records</q> section of the file and use that as a template to create more records.</li>
<li>When you have finished adding the new records into the file, save the changes and then re-load the file in <em>PAM</em>.</li>
<li>Then save it again <em>with a password</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason that this has to be done without a password is because I have not yet written a command line utility to encrypt/decrypt the files. It should be straightforward to do because it uses the standard <code>"AWS_256-CBC"</code> algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="edit-record">Edit Record</h3>
<p>To edit a record, select it from the records list and click or tap on the <code>"Edit"</code> button to popup the edit dialogue <em>which is exactly the same</em> as the dialogue used to create a new record.</p>
<p>In fact, it is implemented using the <em>same code</em> so you can use the instructions from the <a href="#create-new-record">Create New Record</a> section to understand how to change or add new fields.</p>
<h3 id="delete-record">Delete Record</h3>
<p>To delete a record, select it from the records list and click or tap on the <code>"Delete"</code> button.</p>
<p><strong>Beware!!! PAM trusts you!!</strong></p>
<p><em>PAM</em> will not ask you if you <em>really</em> want to delete the record. It will just go ahead and delete it without fanfare <em>so be careful</em>.</p>
<h3 id="clone-record">Clone Record</h3>
<p>To clone a record, select it from the records list and click or tap on the <code>"Clone"</code> button. This will create a new record that you can edit.</p>
<p>The clone operation is described in detail in the <a href="#create-new-record">Create New Record</a> section under the <a href="#method-2-clone-approach">Method 2: Clone Approach</a> subsection.</p>
<h3 id="clear-records">Clear Records</h3>
<p>Clear all of the records currently defined.</p>
<p>This is normally done automatically when a new file is loaded but could be useful if you want to enter new a set of records from scratch using the currently defined fields. Of course, you could simply delete all of the records manually but this is simpler.</p>
<p>To clear all records choose the <q><img src="../icons/black/trash3-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Clear Records</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section for screenshots.</p>
<p>This option will ask you to confirm.</p>
<h3 id="save-file">Save File</h3>
<p>To save records and preferences to a file by choose the <q><img src="../icons/black/file-arrow-down-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Save File</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section for screenshots.</p>
<p>This is the save file dialogue.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-file-save.png" width="400" alt="file-save"></p>
<p>If you want the records to be encrypted, enter or generate a password as described in <a href="#password-generator">Password Generator</a> section.</p>
<p>If you want to copy the records to the clipboard enter a dot <code>"."</code> as the filename.</p>
<p>Make sure that you do not forget this password. It is the <em>master</em> password this is used to unlock all of the records and <em>PAM</em> does <em>not</em> keep track of it. That means that if the password is lost, <em>PAM</em> cannot recover the data it is lost forever.</p>
<p>More details about the encryption algorithm used can be found in <a href="#reason-6-secure-context-encryption">Reason 6: Secure Context Encryption</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if you do not enter a password, the output will be plain javascript that can be read by anyone.</p>
<p>Plain javascript is <em>NOT</em> secure.</p>
<p>If you have records with passwords <em>ALWAYS</em> use a password unless you understand the consequences. For example, saving the data without a password can sometimes be convenient because it allows you to see how the <em>PAM</em> data is organized which can aid automation.</p>
<h3 id="load-file">Load File</h3>
<p>To load records and preferences from a file by choose the <q><img src="../icons/black/file-arrow-up-fill.svg" height='32' width='32' /> Load File</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section for screenshots.</p>
<p>This is the load file dialogue.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-file-load.png" width="400" alt="file-load"></p>
<p>If the file was saved with a password, you must enter that password or the file will prompt for the password when loading.</p>
<h5 id="load-example-records">Load Example Records</h5>
<p>If you wish to load the example records file, click or tap on the <q>Load Example Records</q> button (#1) to load the following example records that can be used to get you started.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-example-records.png" width="400" alt="file-load-example-records"></p>
<h5 id="load-example-recipe">Load Example Recipe</h5>
<p>If you wish to load the example recipes file, click or tap on the <q>Load Example Recipes</q> button (#2) and PAM will load this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae-open.png" width="400" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<h5 id="load-records-from-url">Load Records from URL</h5>
<p>Click or tap on the <q>Load Records from URL</q> button (#3) to load a file from the web.</p>
<p>This is typically used when a PAM records file is shared because no changes can be made.</p>
<h5 id="paste-records-from-clipboard">Paste Records from Clipboard</h5>
<p>Click or tap on the <q>Paste Records from Clipboard</q> button (#4) to paste records from the clipboard.</p>
<p>This is typically used when records are copies to the clipboard from a save operation or manually after editing.</p>
<h3 id="get-help">Get Help</h3>
<p>To get this help message, choose the <code>"Help"</code> option from the menu.</p>
<p>If you find a bug or want to request a change or submit an improvement, go to the <a href="#pam---personal-account-manager">Metadata section</a> at the top of this help and click or tap on the project link.</p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences allow you to customized the behavior of the app. The defaults are set so that most people will never have to change anything.</p>
<p>The preferences dialogue is a big one. It is broken into 4 sections to make it easier to understand:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Search - preferences that control searches.</li>
<li>Passwords - preferences that control password creation and length.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous - preferences for other stuff.</li>
<li>Record Fields - the definitions of the available fields.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each preference is discussed in more detail in the subsections below.</p>
<h3 id="search-preferences">Search Preferences</h3>
<p><img src="./pam-prefs-search.png" width="400" alt="pam-prefs-search"></p>
<p>These preferences control search options. See the <a href="#search">Search</a> section for an example.</p>
<h4 id="case-insensitive-searches">Case Insensitive Searches</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches are case insensitive, otherwise they are case sensitive.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-titles">Search Record Titles</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record titles, otherwise they do not.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-field-names">Search Record Field Names</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field names, otherwise they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that contained a specific field.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-field-values">Search Record Field Values</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field values, otherwise they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that contained a specific field value like an obsolete email or really old password.</p>
<h3 id="password-preferences">Password Preferences</h3>
<p><img src="./pam-prefs-password.png" width="400" alt="pam-prefs-password"></p>
<p>These preferences control automatic password creation.</p>
<p>For more information about passwords see <a href="#password-fields">Password Fields</a></p>
<h4 id="minimum-password-length">Minimum Password Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 12.</p>
<p>I would recommend not making it shorter than the default unless a website specifically demands it because shorter passwords are easier to crack.</p>
<h4 id="maximum-password-length">Maximum Password Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 32.</p>
<p>I would recommend making it longer than the default if you can but many websites have an upper bound for the length of password. The chosen default seems to work for most of them.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-min-word-length">Memorable Password Min Word Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum size of a word in a generated memorable password. &gt; It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 2.</p>
<p>If you do not want short words like <code>'as'</code> or <code>'it'</code>, then make this longer. I would not recommend making it shorter.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-word-separator">Memorable Password Word Separator</h4>
<p>The string used to separate the words in a generated memorable password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is a single character: <code>'/'</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the character, add any string that you like. It can be multiple characters. Other reasonable choices might be <code>':'</code> or <code>'.'</code> or <code>'@@'</code> or whatever you like. It is best not to use letters.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-min-words">Memorable Password Min Words</h4>
<p>The minimum number of words in a generated memorable password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 3.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-max-tries">Memorable Password Max Tries</h4>
<p>The maximum number of attempts to generate a memorable password that meets the specified criteria from the other password preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 10000.</p>
<p>There is normally no need to ever change this but, if you change it and make it too small, <em>PAM</em> will report errors if it fails to generate passwords after the maximum number of tries.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-prefix">Memorable Password Prefix</h4>
<p>The prefix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'A1!!/'</code> to meet the criteria which might create passwords like <code>'A1!!/html/wishes/combined'</code> or <code>'A1!!/rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-suffix">Memorable Password Suffix</h4>
<p>The suffix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'/A1!!'</code> to meet the criteria which might create passwords like <code>'html/wishes/combined/A1!!'</code> or <code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica/A1!!'</code>.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-preferences">Miscellaneous Preferences</h3>
<p><img src="./pam-prefs-miscellaneous.png" width="400" alt="pam-prefs-miscellaneous"></p>
<p>These are the preferences that didn’t fall into the other categories.</p>
<h4 id="log-status-to-the-console">Log Status to the Console</h4>
<p>Log status messages to the console as well as the screen to aid debugging.</p>
<p>The default is false which says do not log status messages to the console.</p>
<p>You might want to enable console logging if you are debugging a problem and are working in a browser that supports debugging.</p>
<h4 id="clear-records-on-load">Clear Records On Load</h4>
<p>Clear all records before loading records from a file.</p>
<p>The default is true which says to clear the records before a loading new records from a file.</p>
<p>If you set this to false, another option titled <q>Load Duplicate Record Strategy</q> will appear that is not normally visible to ask you with strategy you want to used for conflicts.</p>
<p>You might set this preference to false if you want to to merge sets of records from different files.</p>
<h4 id="enable-printing">Enable Printing</h4>
<p>Click this to add the Print option to the menu.</p>
<p>This is what the enable printing preference looks like in the preferences dialogue.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-prefs-enable-printing-check.png" width="400" alt="pam-prefs-enable-printing-check"></p>
<p>Once it is enabled, the <q>Print</q> option will appear at the bottom of the menu as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-prefs-enable-printing-menu.png" width="400" alt="pam-prefs-enable-printing-menu"></p>
<p>When you click on <q>Print</q>, PAM will print the records with the passwords visible. This is what it looks like for the example records.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-prefs-enable-printing-example.png" width="400" alt="pam-prefs-enable-printing-example"></p>
<p>This capability is useful if you want a paper copy of your records but it is a security risk. If you choose to enable this option, make sure that the paper copy is stored securely.</p>
<p>Disable this option (the default) if you intend to share PAM records with multiple users from a read-only URL.</p>
<h4 id="load-duplicate-record-strategy">Load Duplicate Record Strategy</h4>
<p>This preference is not visible unless the <q>Clear Records On Load</q> preference is false.</p>
<p>It presents three strategies for handling duplicate records during a load operation: <q>allow</q>, <q>ignore</q>, <q>replace</q>.</p>
<p>The <q>allow</q> strategy allows duplicate records to exist by cloning them. For example if a record with the title <q>Google</q> exists in the records and in the file being loaded, the record from the file would be renamed to <q>Google Clone</q>.</p>
<p>The <q>ignore</q> strategy ignores the duplicate record that is being loaded. If there is a conflict it prefers the one already present.</p>
<p>The <q>replace</q> strategy ignores the duplicate record that already exists. If there is a conflict it prefers the record being loaded.</p>
<h4 id="clone-field-values-when-cloning-records">Clone Field Values when Cloning Records</h4>
<p>This preference specifies that all data is kept when cloning a record.</p>
<p>Remember that cloning a record is very simple and powerful way to create new records with the same fields but you have to delete the existing values before entering new ones which is very simple.</p>
<p>The default is false which says to keep the field values when cloning.</p>
<p>Set this preference if you want to avoid deleting the fields manually.</p>
<h4 id="require-record-fields">Require Record Fields</h4>
<p>This determines whether a record can be created with no fields.</p>
<p>If it is true, then a new record must have a least one field defined.</p>
<p>The default is false which means that records can be created with no fields so that records.</p>
<h4 id="enable-editable-field-name">Enable Editable Field Name</h4>
<p>This preference defines whether or not the user can change a field name on a <em>per record</em> basis.</p>
<p>Setting this preference is not recommended because the presence of the <q>name</q> input can be confusing for users, a better approach is to simply add a new field to the default fields in the preference section as described in the <a href="#fields">Fields</a> section.</p>
<h5 id="not-enabled">Not Enabled</h5>
<p>This is what it looks likes when it is unchecked (false).</p>
<p><img src="./pam-fld-name-edit-unchecked.png" width="400" alt="false"/></p>
<p><img src="./pam-fld-name-edit-off.png" width="400" alt="false"/></p>
<p>When this is not enabled, the user can only choose record fields from the <q>Record Fields</q> section of the preferences. See the <a href="#record-fields">Record Fields</a> section for more details.</p>
<h5 id="enabled">Enabled</h5>
<p>This is what it looks likes when it is checked (true).</p>
<p><img src="./pam-fld-name-edit-checked.png" width="400" alt="false"/></p>
<p><img src="./pam-fld-name-edit-on.png" width="400" alt="true"/></p>
<p>The user can replace the default field name (in this case <q>name</q>) with whatever they want, perhaps something like <q>full name</q> or <q>first name</q> or <q>last name</q>. The <q>value</q> field is where the name is actually entered.</p>
<h4 id="filepass-cache-strategy">filePass Cache Strategy</h4>
<p>This defines the browser cache strategy for the file password. The options are <code>none</code>, <code>prefs</code>, <code>local</code> and <code>session</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>none</code> option means that the file password is never stored. The file password is <em>not</em> remembered for the file load and save operations. Each time you load or save a file you must re-enter it.</p>
<p>The <code>global</code> option means that the file password is stored in a global window session variable. The file password is remembered for the file load and save operations. It is remembered until the browser tab is closed.</p>
<p>The <code>local</code> option means that the file password is stored in <code>localStorage</code>. The file password is remembered for the file load and save operations. It is remembered until it is explicitly reset.</p>
<p>The <code>session</code> option means that the file password is stored in <code>sessionStorage</code>. The file password is remembered for the file load and save operations. It is remembered until the browser tab is closed.</p>
<h4 id="custom-about">Custom About</h4>
<p>Customized HTML that is added to the about page. It can be used in cases where the field records have been customized to provide an explanation or link to internal documentation.</p>
<p>Its use is described in the <a href="#about">About</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="record-fields">Record Fields</h3>
<p>These are the default record fields that are used when creating or editing record fields. They can be can be changed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#fields">Fields</a> section for more information about record fields.</p>
<p>At the top of the section there is <img src="../icons/black/plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="add"/> icon that is used to create a new record field.</p>
<p>Each default record field has a name, a type (from a pulldown menu) and a delete button (<img src="../icons/black/trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/>) that you click to delete the record field.</p>
<p>The record field names must be unique but you can modify them. They are stored with the each record file individually.</p>
<p>This is what the default records filed preference dialogue looks like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-default-record-fields.png" width="400" alt="default"/></p>
<h3 id="saving-preferences">Saving Preferences</h3>
<p>You <em>must</em> scroll to the bottom of the dialogue and click on the <code>"Save"</code> button at the end to save changes. If you do not, any changes you made will be lost.</p>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em>, like all web applications, has security challenges. By fully disclosing them here you can understand the challenges and improve your ability to protect your record data.</p>
<h3 id="mitm">MITM</h3>
<p>MITM refers to <q>Monster In The Middle</q> attacks or, historically, <q>Man In The Middle</q> attacks. It an attack where a hostile eavesdropper inserts themselves in the communications stream between a client and a server to capture or alter the communications for nefarious purposes like stealing credentials.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is not susceptible to this attack because it <em>does not communicate with a server</em>. That is because it is a single page web application that is downloaded and run within your browser. All data is local. Nothing is ever transferred over the internet for an eavesdropper to capture.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-web-site-security">Third Party Web Site Security</h3>
<p>Third party web site security can be a major source of cybersecurity vulnerabilities because clients cannot know how well such cybersecurity vulnerabilities are mitigated unless that site publishes a detailed report, on a periodic basis, of how often they were attacked successfully and how many attacks they have successfully fended off.</p>
<p>Sadly, most companies do not provide that information. If you are using a password manager or any other service that uses a server, you might want to consider asking them how vulnerable they are to cyberattacks. At a minimum, you will want to understand what is done to protect your data from insider attacks where an employee steals the data.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can get information about the security of a site by looking at Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) reports. See <a href="https://www.cve.org/">https://www.cve.org/</a> for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor reporting of third party web site cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures was one thing that motivated me to write <em>PAM</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because <em>PAM</em> does not send the data to a server, it is not vulnerable to how cybersecurity is managed on the server by a third party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is not sending data out by monitoring outbound traffic from your system. <em>PAM</em> never sends any outbound data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PAM</em> encryption and decryption operations are provided by and run <em>inside</em> the <em>secure context</em> of the browser. This is the same <em>secure context</em> used for accessing sites securely for transactions, like your bank. In practice this means that you must access <em>PAM</em> from an HTTPS site.</p>
<p>The safety and security of <em>secure context</em> operations is taken very seriously by the internet standards organization and the organizations that develop the major browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a> and in <a href="#reason-6-secure-context-encryption">Reason 6: Secure Context Encryption</a>.</p>
<h3 id="site-reliability">Site Reliability</h3>
<p>Although it is not an attack vector <em>per se</em>, site reliability is another consideration when choosing a web application because a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the site or a power failure at the site could make it unusable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most modern web applications are built using commercial cloud software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) products from vendors like AWS, Azure and GCP so they tend to be <em>very</em> reliable but it is still something to be aware of because if the site or the gateway to the site goes down so does the web application.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em>, is hosted and served from <em>github.io</em> which also appears to be very reliable but if you are concerned, you can host it wherever you like. Also <em>PAM</em> does not do any backend server communication (as mentioned earlier) so it will like continue to run even if the site goes down temporarily because, once it is loaded, it will stay resident until you close the browser tab.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is where you store your <em>PAM</em> record file(s). I use iCloud which is also quite reliable and allows access to iCloud files directly from my computers, mobile devices and tablets.</p>
<p>Just make sure that whichever infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering you choose it is reliable as well because you don’t want to lose access to your file because the IaaS service is not available.</p>
<p>Of course you could simply load and save the data to a local file but that might restrict access to it from other devices (like mobile phones or tables) and you would have to be very diligent about keeping it backed up.</p>
<h3 id="over-the-shoulder-surfing-attack">Over the Shoulder Surfing Attack</h3>
<p>The user enters the record data in decrypted form, so it may be vulnerable to over the shoulder surfing attacks where someone or something (like a camera) watches or films the user typing or opening a record and then clicking or tapping on a password field to display the password in plaintext which could allow that information to be stolen.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be mitigated by being aware of your surroundings to make sure you are not being watched or filmed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is different and easier to mitigate than <q>key-logging and screen recording</q> as discussed in the next subsection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="malware-key-logging-and-screen-recording">Malware: Key Logging and Screen Recording</h3>
<p>If malware that takes screenshots or does key logging has been installed on your computer, phone or tablet, you are in trouble for a variety of reasons. It means that an attacker can see what you are doing and capture what you are typing.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate these forms of attacks is to keep your system up to date by installing security patches and by using some sort of security tool or tools to protect your system or, at the very least, recognize the infection.</p>
<h3 id="malware-clipboard-attack">Malware: Clipboard Attack</h3>
<p>Yet another type of vulnerability is the <q>clipboard attack</q> if/when data is copied to the clipboard for cut and paste operations. This vulnerability exists because the clipboard is a global resource that can be accessed by other, independent applications.</p>
<p>Clipboard attacks can be mitigated by making sure that your computer does not have malware installed or by not copying to the clipboard. Although it is probably impractical to not use the clipboard at all so, if you do use the clipboard, make sure that you always reset it after any copy/paste operation to minimize any chances that it will be captured by malware or observed by an attacker. You can reset it by simply selection a single letter or word and copying it.</p>
<p>Another, perhaps better, way to mitigate the clipboard vulnerability <em>might</em> be to eliminate the need for the clipboard by modifying <em>PAM</em> to automatically login in for you based on record data using an HTTP POST operation but that is not currently available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I say <em>might</em> here, because I do not know how secure POST operations are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="unattended-browser">Unattended Browser</h3>
<p>If you leave the browser unattended without locking your screen after you have loaded your record data, someone can sit down and see the records because they are impersonating you <em>after you have logged in</em>.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate this attack is to always lock your screen when you leave the computer unattended.</p>
<h3 id="website-spoofing">Website Spoofing</h3>
<p>Web site spoofing could be used to direct you to a website that could be used to steal your information using a look alike web application.</p>
<p>To mitigate that make sure that you accessing the <em>PAM</em> from a known, trusted site.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about this, you can always download, build and run <em>PAM</em> from your own trusted site.</p>
<h3 id="dictionary-and-brute-force-password-attacks">Dictionary and Brute Force Password Attacks</h3>
<p>In general a brute force attack is any attack that uses trial and error to crack passwords.</p>
<p>A dictionary attack is a brute force password attack that tries every password in a dictionary to break decrypt sensitive data.</p>
<p>Both attacks are very effective in cases where the attacker has the ability to try many passwords without being locked out and where the password is short.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute force atttacks because it can be run locally where the attacker can setup an automatic system to try to decrypt the file using the set of available passwords.</p>
<p>Sites that require passwords for authentication can mitigate this type of attack by limiting the number of login attempts allowed.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> can also mitigate these types of attacks but it cannot do so <em>automatically</em> because the attacker has access to the source code. Instead you can mitigate these attacks by using strong (high entropy) passwords.</p>
<p>To give you some feel for just how effective this approach is, consider a simple example where we have a password composed of say 20 pseudo-random upper case letters (26), lower case letters (26), digits (10) and 2 special characters.</p>
<p>Thus for 20 characters, there are 64<sup>20</sup> or 1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 (~1.3 undecillion) possible passwords which is which is <em>one heck of a lot possibilities</em>!</p>
<p>If an attacker were to try to crack such a password using a super powerful computer that could perform <em>1 billion tests per second</em> (close to the limit of todays technology), it would take something on the order of about a sextillion (10<sup>21</sup>) years to crack which means that your data is pretty safe if you use such a password.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you use a simple, six character password like <q><code>secret</code></q> it would take about about a minute so don’t do that.</p>
<p>Ideas for generating strong password are discussed in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>In summary, security can never be fully guaranteed, the best way to protect your data is to follow commonly recommended security practices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep all of your security patches up to date.</li>
<li>Keep malware off of your systems.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are not observed.</li>
<li>Never share sensitive information (like passwords).</li>
<li>Backup your data.</li>
<li>Use a strong password for encrypting your files.
<ol type="1">
<li>It should be at least 20 characters.</li>
<li>It should not contain personally identifiable information like dates.</li>
<li>It should be memorable and fairly easy to type.</li>
<li>I suggest using a memorable password of length 30 or more that contains 3 to 5 words with a custom prefix and suffix. Perhaps something with a structure like this: <q><code>A1/jeans/chosen/since/tuition?!!</code></q> (do NOT use this specific password!).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Make sure that the website URL is what you expect.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multi-factor-authentication">Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Several folks have asked me why Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was not included in <em>PAM</em> to provide and additional layer of security.</p>
<p>In general the MFA approach assumes that the users identity must be checked and validated (authentication) so that the site offering the services knows that it is dealing with the valid user not an impersonator <em>which is a great thing</em> but it is not necessary for <em>PAM</em> because <em>PAM</em> has no <em>site</em>.</p>
<p>Instead <em>PAM</em> is a single page web application with <em>no backend processing</em>, which, once it is loaded, makes it more like a local word processor that is tailored to managing customized records in <em>local</em> files so any additional communication over the internet represents a risk as does storing any user information. Everything is done inside the browser in a secure context.</p>
<p>No outbound information is ever sent to the internet unless the user specifically requests it via the <code>"Load File"</code> and <code>"Save File"</code> operations while using cloud storage but at that point all data is encrypted both at the file level and as the HTTPS transport level which is required for the browser secure context which, in turn, is required by <em>PAM</em> to function which is pretty safe if you protect your data with a strong password.</p>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is functioning securely by monitoring outbound internet traffic. You should never see any outbound traffic from <em>PAM</em> that is not related to the file load and save operations.</p>
<p>For all of the above reasons, I felt the MFA would not improve security and, hence, was not needed.</p>
<h2 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h2>
<p>The examples in this section talk about how to use this app under different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="personal-account-records">Personal Account Records</h3>
<p>This is the most common usage. It is where personal account records are stored so that you have a permanent, encrypted record of all of your passwords.</p>
<h4 id="create-record-file">Create Record File</h4>
<p>To create a file with a single record follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app: <a href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/</a>.
<ul>
<li>This can be done from any device, like your phone, tablet or computer but you must have access to cloud storage (on iphone and ipads that would be iCloud).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select the <code>"New Record"</code> option from the menu in the upper right hand corner.</li>
<li>When the new record dialogue pops up, enter the account name as the title, an example might be <q>Google email</q>.</li>
<li>Add fields like <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q> and set their values.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>At this point it will appear as your first record on the display.</li>
<li>Now save it to a file by selecting <q>Save File</q> from the menu.</li>
<li>Enter the file name, perhaps something like <code>"mystuff.pam"</code> or <code>"joe.pam"</code> if your name is <q>Joe</q> or <code>"account.pam"</code>.
<ul>
<li>I have found that some devices do not like the <code>".pam"</code> file extension. If that is the case use the <code>".txt"</code> file extension. Everything loves that and the data is guaranteed to be ASCII text (even when encrypted).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enter a password.
<ol type="1">
<li>This is the password that you need to access all of the records in the file.</li>
<li>The password is <em>not</em> stored so make sure that you keep track of it somewhere because if it is lost, the records <em>cannot</em> be retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your data is stored. You can add as many additional records as you want or change existing records. As long as you save them, they will be available to you.</p>
<h4 id="use-record-data-to-log-into-a-site">Use Record Data to Log into a Site</h4>
<p>To use the data to log into a site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the <q>url</q> link so that the site opens up in a different tab.</li>
<li>Enter the login name or email by clicking or tapping on the <img src="../icons/black/clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon next to the login name and paste into the site.</li>
<li>Enter the password by clicking or tapping on the <img src="../icons/black/clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon next to the password and paste into the site.
<ol type="1">
<li>You do <em>not</em> need to make the password visible to do this.</li>
<li>It picks up the correct password even when it is hidden.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="edit-an-existing-record">Edit an Existing Record</h3>
<p>To edit an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the edit <img src="../icons/black/pencil-square.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to make the necessary changes to the fields or title.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="delete-an-existing-record">Delete an Existing Record</h4>
<p>To delete an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the delete <img src="../icons/black/trash.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="clone-an-existing-record">Clone an Existing Record</h4>
<p>This is a really powerful operation that allows you to quickly create records with the same fields.</p>
<p>To clone a record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the edit <img src="../icons/black/files.svg" height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to update the fields.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to disable the copying of field data turn off the <q>Clone Field Values when Cloning Records</q> preference. That avoids having to delete each old field value before typing in the new field value.</p>
<h3 id="share-credentials-for-a-small-group">Share Credentials for a Small Group</h3>
<p>This scenario assumes that a small group of trusted people wants to share a common file of account records with credentials that can only be decrypted using a single shared password that is only known to the group.</p>
<p>This might be suitable for a <em>small</em> group that requires administrative access to a <em>small</em> number of accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it involves sharing a password, this approach may be too insecure for some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this approach is adopted, it would be wise to change the shared password frequently, to audit all access to the shared file as well as audit all access to the accounts. Also, since the shared file <em>must</em> be on a mounted volume that can be seen by the input file dialogue, access to the mount and, by extension, to the file can also be restricted.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to share a <em>PAM</em> file.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the mounted volume where the file will be located.</li>
<li>Create the pam file and populate it with the shared records.
<ul>
<li>Optionally, you may wish to limit the record fields to <code>login</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>note</code> and <code>host</code> by editing the preferences and removing the other fields since all of the records have a specific, known format.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save the file to the mounted volume with a password.</li>
<li>Communicate the location of the file and the password to the members of the group in a secure way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another approach is to create the encrypted <em>PAM</em> file and store it on a publicly accessible web site. Users can then use option #3 in <a href="#load-file">Load File</a> dialogue to load it.</p>
<h3 id="recipes">Recipes</h3>
<p>This is a bit of contrived example because you could easily keep all of your recipes with your other personal account data but it might be useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>The key notion here is the idea of creating two new fields in the preference dialogue: <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q>, and then use them when you enter recipes.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to get the fields defined.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the preferences dialogue from the menu.</li>
<li>Add the new fields by clicking or tapping on the <img src="../icons/black/plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon in the <code>"Record Fields"</code> in the preferences section.
<ol type="1">
<li><code>"ingredients"</code> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
<li><code>"instructions"</code> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete all of the other record fields defined in the preferences by clicking or tapping on the <img src="../icons/black/trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon because there is no need for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search by an ingredient, set the <q>Search Record Field Values</q> preference to true by clicking or tapping on it and then saving it.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>This is another somewhat of contrived example because you could easily keep all of your book reviews with your other personal account data but it might be useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>For my book reviews, I enter the book title as the record title and added the following fields using the methodology described in the recipes section above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I <em>only</em> add records for books that have been read.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="developer-notes">Developer Notes</h2>
<p>These are things that developers might be interested in.</p>
<p>It was built using pure javascript and relies on the browser secure context to provide encryption and decryption.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a> to make it work better in mobile browsers.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://docs.pylenium.io/">pylenium</a> to test the web app which means the github actions file <a href="https://github.com/jlinoff/pam/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml">main.yml</a> is pretty interesting because it demonstrates to how to build a complete web test environment using python on an Ubuntu:20.04 VM with a local web server.</p>
<p>Not only that but I wrote my own little, lightweight javascript library to provide a limited functional interface to make coding HTML DOM constructs easier. See the <a href="www/js/lib.js">www/js/lib.js</a> source code module.</p>

<h3 id="build-pam">Build PAM</h3>
<p>Here are the steps to build PAM.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jlinoff/pam.git</code></li>
<li><code>make</code> or <code>make init</code>
<ul>
<li>This installs the python test infrastructure including pylenium as well as bootstrap 5.</li>
<li>It also creates the <code>www/js/version.js</code> file and the help.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make run</code>
<ul>
<li>Runs the python server on port 8081 so that you can access the app locally from http://localhost:8081 in a secure context.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="create-favicon">Create Favicon</h3>
<p>I could not automate this process because I used a web service.</p>

<li>Created an image using <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>.</li>
<li>Uploaded the image to <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/">https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/</a>. It converted the image automatically when the <q>Download</q> button was clicked.</li>
<li>Per the instructions on the site, then downloaded the following files into <code>pam/www</code>
<ul>
<li>android-chrome-192x192.png</li>

<li>favicon-32x32.png</li>
<li>favicon.ico</li>
<li>site.webmanifest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also per the instructions on the site, added the link tags to <code>pam/www/index.html</code>.</li>
<li>Edited the newly added link tags in <code>pam/www/index.html</code> to make them relative by prepending a dot to the <code>href</code> path) like this.</li>

<h3 id="test-pam">Test PAM</h3>
<p>Here are the steps to test PAM.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>make test</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The test infrastructure uses python and pylenium to automate user interactions.</p>
<h3 id="release-pam">Release PAM</h3>
<p>Note that <em>PAM</em> will not work unless it is released to a secure (HTTPS) server because it requires a <em>secure context</em>.</p>
<p>Note that installing it on local server (localhost or 127.0.0.1) is considered secure which is convenient for personal use.</p>
<p>Here are the steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the <code>VERSION</code> file using semantic versioning.</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to propagate the new version and update <code>README.md</code></li>
<li>Run <code>make web</code> to create <code>pam-www.tar</code> which contains the app in <code>pam/www</code>.</li>
<li>Untar the <code>pam-www.tar</code> on your site.</li>
</ol>
<p>This pre-supposes that you have cloned the pam project from github.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>This is one of the several times that I have written a password manager from scratch over the past twenty years and it is intended to be the last. Because this version while it is <em>far</em> from perfect, is good enough for my needs and should provide a decent start for someone who wants to improve it.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the evolution of this project read on.</p>
<p>Below are three previous implementations that are still around followed by a brief chronology of how things progressed over the years.</p>

<p>This is the older effort that was implemented using Rust and javascript and was funded by my employer at that time (eSentire, Inc.) for a hack week project. The UI and the implementation are quite complex.</p>
<p>The acronym stands for Quantum Safe Password Manager. An ambitious name to say the least.</p>

<p>This is the precursor to pam. It was implemented using Rust and javascript. I used it for a several of years.</p>
<p>It has poor implementations of the record create and edit dialogues and a poor implementation of the password generator dialogue.</p>
<p>Other than that it was okay.</p>

<p>This is the latest incarnation and it is pure javascript. It fixes some of the problems seen in the earlier attempts and it leverages <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a> to make it work better in mobile browsers. The implementation is a bit simpler but like all of the other attempts there is still plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>The acronym stands for Personal Accounts Manager or Password Manager or whatever. It doesn’t really matter. I just wanted something short and easy to remember.</p>
<h4 id="chronology">Chronology</h4>
<p>I first wrote a password manager in the early 2000’s in javascript. In those days I had to write my own uncertified implementations of the encryption algorithms like AES-256-CBC and AES-256-GCM and DES3 but that was perfectly okay because, back then, my day job involved a lot of security stuff like designing hardware and software (in C++) to implement certified algorithms.</p>
<p>As time went on, I would continue to re-implement password managers as a hobby to learn new skills and refresh old ones. That pretty quickly got me into javascript, python, docker, golang and, a few years ago, to rust. It has been a fun journey and I learned a great deal.</p>
<p>By the time, I got around to writing <em>PAM</em>, I was using the prototype for a lot more than password management (mostly because I could enter records from my phone). It was a useful idiom for record management in general which is where things are today.</p>
<p>You will see that I dropped Rust in the latest incarnation but that is not because I don’t think Rust is suitable or wonderful. Rust is most definitely suitable and wonderful. I dropped it because I did not need it. The secure context had everything I needed.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, I would have done this in emacs <code>org-mode</code> (yes, I am one of those) but I was never able to get remote access from multiple devices working as well as I liked so I stuck with javascript.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that there is something here that others can learn from this.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed playing around with password management over the years. The journey has been great fun.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
