<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> or Personal Account Manager is a free and open source
single page web app that runs in your browser in a secure context that
enables you to securely manage your confidential personal account data
as searchable records in a secure, flexible, and persistent manner
<em>without ever having to visit a server</em> because it stores the
data in a file that you control. The file is encrypted so even if it
were stolen the data would be safe <em>if the password you used to
encrypt it was strong</em>.</p>
<p>You can run the application locally, from your own server or from the
public github.io servers here: <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html</a>.</p>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Probably the easiest way to understand how the app works is to look
at some simple examples that reflect common ways to use the app.</p>
<h5 id="menu">Menu</h5>
<p>The menu is the control center for the app. It provides the basic
operations for creating records, loading records, saving them and it
provide information about the app including this help.</p>
<p><img src="./image03.png" alt="menu"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are seven menu options: <q>About</q>,
<q>Preferences</q>, <q>New Record</q>, <q>Clear Records</q>, <q>Load
File</q>, <q>Save File</q>, and <q>Help</q>.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./info-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> About</q>
entry to see information about the app.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Preferences</q> entry
to see the preferences dialogue which allows you to customize some of
the app behavior. There is a lot of stuff so you might want to read the
preferences section before trying it.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./plus-circle-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> New
Record</q> entry to create a new record.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./trash3-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clear
Records</q> entry to delete all of the records. This is useful for times
when you want to create a new collection of records that is saved in a
separate file. For example, if you wanted to create a collection
personal accounts in one file and a collection shared accounts for a
group of folks (like a development team sharing AWS accounts).</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-up-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Load
File</q> entry to load a records file. You will typically have to enter
a password to decrypt the file so that the records can be displayed.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-down-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Save
File</q> entry to save all of the records to a file. You will want to
enter a password to make sure that the records in the file are
encrypted. Encryption is done using the AWS-CBC-256 encryption algorithm
which is known to be secure (even to quantum attacks) but it means that
you must remember it because the file records cannot be retrieved if the
password is lost.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./question-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Help</q>
entry to see this help message.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h5 id="load-records">Load Records</h5>
<p>This example shows what the records look like. It shows seven records
that contain confidential information for <q>Amazon</q>, <q>Email</q>,
<q>Facebook</q>, <q>Github</q>, <q>Google</q>, <q>Netflix</q> and
<q>Stack Exchange</q> fictional accounts.</p>
<p>The records were created by clicking on the <q>New Record</q> option
from the menu and then adding the individual fields in some cases or by
clicking the <q>Clone</q> option on an existing record and updating the
field values for the other cases. The <q>Clone</q> operation is
particularly convenient for creating records with similar formats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The information is all made up and has no relation to any real
accounts AFAIK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./image01.png" alt="Example records"></p>
<p>As you can see there are seven records in an accordion format in the
middle of the screen. You can click on each one to expand it to make the
record data visible.</p>
<p>To get the information for an account you click or tap the
button.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h5 id="expand-record">Expand Record</h5>
<p>The most common operation is expanding a record to see the
information. This example shows the fictional <q>Facebook</q> account
data.</p>
<p><img src="./image02.png" alt="Expanded Facebook record"></p>
<p>You can see that there are three fields in the record: <q>url</q>,
<q>login</q> and <q>password</q>, next to each field there is a icon
that looks like a clipboard
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/>. If
you click or tap it the field contents will be copied to the clipboard
so that you can paste them into a login dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the fields are completely customizable. You can have as
many as you want. Fields are added, modified and deleted by the
<q>Edit</q> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the cliboard icon there is another icon that looks
like an eye <img src="./eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/>.
that shows up for password field. If you click or tap it, the password
will be shown in plaintext and the icon will change to an eye with a
slash through it
<img src="./eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye-slash"/>. By
default all passwords are hidden so that they are not visible to casual
observers. Click it again to re-hide the password.</p>
<p>In addition there are three buttons at the bottom
<q><img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Delete</q> to delete
the record,
<q><img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clone</q> to clone
the record and
<q><img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Edit</q> to
edit the record fields.</p>
<h4 id="preferences">Preferences</h4>
<p>Preferences allow you to customized the behavior of the app. The
defaults are set so that most people will never have to change
anything.</p>
<p>The preferences dialogue is a big one. It is broken into 4
sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Search - preferences that control searches.</li>
<li>Passwords - preferences that control password creation and length.
<ol type="1">
<li>There are two types of passwords: cryptic and memorable.</li>
<li>Cryptic passwords consist of letters, digits and special characters
in a single string.
<ul>
<li>Cryptic passwords are very hard to memorize for most people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Memorable passwords are composed of lower case English words with an
optional prefix, an optional separator between each word and an optional
suffix.
<ul>
<li>Memorable passwords are easier to memorize for most people.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Miscellaneous - preferences for other stuff.</li>
<li>Record Fields - the definitions of the available fields.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each preference is discussed in more detail in the subsections below.
##### Miscellaneous Preferences These preferences don’t fall into a
single category.</p>
<h5 id="record-fields">Record Fields</h5>
<p>These are the pre-defined record fields that are used when creating
or editing records. They can be overridden.</p>
<h5 id="search-preferences">Search Preferences</h5>
<p>These preferences control search options.</p>
<h6 id="case-insensitive-searches">Case Insensitive Searches</h6>
<p>If enabled, all searches are case insensitive, otherwise they are
case sensitive.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h6 id="search-record-titles">Search Record Titles</h6>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record titles, otherwise they do
not.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h6 id="search-record-field-names">Search Record Field Names</h6>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field names, otherwise
they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that
contained a specific field.</p>
<h6 id="search-record-field-values">Search Record Field Values</h6>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field values, otherwise
they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that
contained a specific field value like an obsolete email or really old
password.</p>
<h5 id="password-preferences">Password Preferences</h5>
<p>These preferences control automatic password creation.</p>
<p>Cryptic passwords consist of letters, digits and special characters
in a single string. An example would look something like this
<code>'N5yAb!XfGa3vELPsK95K4/AAz8mts'</code>. Cryptic passwords are very
hard to memorize for most people.</p>
<p>There are two types of passwords: cryptic and memorable. Memorable
passwords are composed of lower case English words with an optional
prefix, an optional separator between each word and an optional suffix.
An example would look something like this
<code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>. q ###### Minimum Password
Length Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable
passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 12.</p>
<p>I would recommend not making it shorter than the default unless a
website specifically demands it because shorter passwords are easier to
crack.</p>
<h6 id="maximum-password-length">Maximum Password Length</h6>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable
passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 32.</p>
<p>I would recommend making it longer than the default if you can but
many websites have an upper bound for the length of password. The chosen
default seems to work for most of them.</p>
<h6 id="memorable-password-min-word-length">Memorable Password Min Word
Length</h6>
<p>Defines the minimum size of a word in a generated memorable password.
&gt; It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 2.</p>
<p>If you do not want short words like <code>'as'</code> or
<code>'it'</code>, then make this longer. I would not recommend making
it shorter.</p>
<h6 id="memorable-password-word-separator">Memorable Password Word
Separator</h6>
<p>The string used to separate the words in a generated memorable
password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is a single character: <code>'/'</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the character, add any string that you like. It
can be multiple characters. Other reasonable choices might be
<code>':'</code> or <code>'.'</code> or <code>'@@'</code> or whatever
you like. It is best not to use letters.</p>
<h6 id="memorable-password-min-words">Memorable Password Min Words</h6>
<p>The minimum number of words in a generated memorable password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 3.</p>
<h6 id="memorable-password-max-tries">Memorable Password Max Tries</h6>
<p>The maximum number of attempts to generate a memorable password that
meets the specified criteria from the other password preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 10000.</p>
<p>There is normally no need to ever change this but, if you change it
and make it too small, <em>PAM</em> will report errors if it fails to
generate passwords after the maximum number of tries.</p>
<h6 id="memorable-password-prefix">Memorable Password Prefix</h6>
<p>The prefix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the
generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper
case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'A1!!/'</code> to
meet the criteria which might create passwords like
<code>'A1!!/html/wishes/combined'</code> or
<code>'A1!!/rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>.</p>
<h6 id="memorable-password-suffix">Memorable Password Suffix</h6>
<p>The suffix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the
generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper
case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'/A1!!'</code> to
meet the criteria which might create passwords like
<code>'html/wishes/combined/A1!!'</code> or
<code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica/A1!!'</code>.</p>
<h5 id="miscellaneous-preferences">Miscellaneous Preferences</h5>
<p>These preferences don’t fall into a single category.</p>
<h5 id="record-fields-1">Record Fields</h5>
<p>These are the pre-defined record fields that are used when creating
or editing records. They can be overridden.</p>
<h3 id="todo-finish-up-preferences">TODO: finish up preferences</h3>
<h4 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em>, like all web applications, has security challenges. By
fully disclosing them here you can understand the challenges and improve
your ability to protect your record data.</p>
<h5 id="mitm">MITM</h5>
<p>Unlike many other web applications, <em>PAM</em> does <em>not</em>
talk to an internet based web server which means that the data is never
transported from your computer over the internet. Because no data is
ever transmitted, it is protected from monster-in-the-middle (MITM)
attacks.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>PAM</em> mitigates MITM attacks by design.</p>
<h5 id="third-party-web-site-security">Third Party Web Site
Security</h5>
<p>Because <em>PAM</em> does not send the data to a server, it is not
vulnerable to how cybersecurity is managed on the server by a third
party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is not sending data out by
monitoring outbound traffic from your system. <em>PAM</em> never sends
any outbound data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, encryption and decryption is run <em>inside</em> the browser
using the <em>secure context of the browser</em>. This is the same
context used for accessing sites securely for transactions, like your
bank. The security of the <em>secure context</em> is taken very
seriously by organizations that develop Chrome, Edge, Firefox and other
browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a
href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a>.</p>
<h5 id="over-the-shoulder-surfing-attack">Over the Shoulder Surfing
Attack</h5>
<p>The user enters the record data in decrypted form, so it may be
vulnerable to over the shoulder surfing attacks where someone or
something (like a camera) watches or films the user typing or opening a
record and then clicking on a password field to display the password in
plaintext which could allow that information to be stolen.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be mitigated by being aware of your
surroundings to make sure you are not being watched or filmed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is different and easier to mitigate than <q>key-logging and
screen recording</q> as discussed in the next subsection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="malware-key-logging-and-screen-recording">Malware: Key Logging
and Screen Recording</h5>
<p>If malware that takes screenshots or does key logging has been
installed on your computer, phone or tablet, you are in trouble for a
variety of reasons. It means that an attacker can see what you are doing
and capture what you are typing.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate these forms of attacks is to keep your
system up to date by installing security patches and by using some sort
of security tool or tools to protect your system.</p>
<h5 id="malware-clipboard-attack">Malware: Clipboard Attack</h5>
<p>Yet another type of vulnerability is the <q>clipboard attack</q>
if/when data is copied to the clipboard for cut and paste operations.
This vulnerability exists because the clipboard is a global resource
that can be accessed by other, independent applications.</p>
<p>Clipboard attacks can be mitigated by making sure that your computer
does not have malware installed or by not copying to the clipboard.
Although it is probably impractical to not use the clipboard at all so,
if you do use the clipboard, make sure that you always reset it after
any copy/paste operation to minimize any chances that it will be
captured by malware or observed by an attacker. You can reset it by
simply selection a single letter or word and copying it.</p>
<p>Another, perhaps better, way to mitigate the clipboard vulnerability
would be to eliminate the need for the clipboard by modifying
<em>PAM</em> to automatically login in for you based on record data
using an HTTP POST operation but that is not currently available.</p>
<h5 id="unattended-browser">Unattended Browser</h5>
<p>If you leave the browser unattended after you have loaded your record
data, someone can sit down and see the records because they are
impersonating you <em>after you have logged in</em>.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate this attach is to always lock your screen
when you leave the computer unattended.</p>
<h5 id="website-spoofing">Website Spoofing</h5>
<p>Web site spoofing could be used to direct you to a website that could
be used to steal your information using a look alike web
application.</p>
<p>To mitigate that make sure that you accessing the <em>PAM</em> from a
known, trusted site.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about this, you can always download, build and
run <em>PAM</em> from your own site.</p>
<h4 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h4>
<p>The examples in this section talk about how to use this app under
different scenarios.</p>
<h5 id="personal-account-records">Personal Account Records</h5>
<p>This is the most common usage. It is where personal account records
are stored so that you have a permanent, encrypted record of all of your
passwords.</p>
<h6 id="create-record-and-file">Create Record and File</h6>
<p>To create a file and a record follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app: <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>Or to wherever you installed it, if you built it locally.</li>
<li>This can be done from any device, like your phone, tablet or
computer but you must have access to cloud storage (on iphone and ipads
that would be iCloud).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Select the <q>Add New Record</q> option from the menu in the upper
right hand corner.</li>
<li>When the new record dialogue pops up, enter the account name as the
title, an example might be <q>Google email</q>.</li>
<li>Add fields like <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>At this point it will appear as your first record on the
display.</li>
<li>Now save it to a file by selecting <q>Save File</q> from the
menu.</li>
<li>Enter the file name, perhaps something like <q>mystuff.pam</q> or
<q>joe.pam</q> if your name is <q>Joe</q>,</li>
<li>Enter a password.
<ol type="1">
<li>This is the password that you need to access all of the records in
the file.</li>
<li>The password is <em>not</em> stored so make sure that you keep track
of it somewhere because if it is lost, the records <em>cannot</em> be
retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your data is stored. You can add as many additional
records as you want or change existing records. As long as you save
them, they will be available to you.</p>
<h6 id="use-record-data-to-log-into-a-site">Use Record Data to Log into
a Site</h6>
<p>To use the data to log into a site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the <q>url</q> link so that the site opens up in a
different tab.</li>
<li>Enter the login name or email by clicking on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the login name and paste into the site.</li>
<li>Enter the password by clicking on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the password and paste into the site.
<ol type="1">
<li>You do <em>not</em> need to make the password visible to do
this.</li>
<li>It picks up the correct password even when it is hidden.</li>
</ol></li>

<h6 id="edit-an-existing-record">Edit an Existing Record</h6>
<p>To edit an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the edit
<img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to make the necessary changes to the fields or
title.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="delete-an-existing-record">Delete an Existing Record</h6>
<p>To delete an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the delete <img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' />
icon.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="clone-an-existing-record">Clone an Existing Record</h6>
<p>This is a really powerful operation that allows you to quickly create
records with the same fields.</p>
<p>To clone a record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click on the edit <img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' />
icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to update the fields.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to disable the copying of field data turn off the
<q>Clone Field Values when Cloning Records</q> preference. That avoids
having to delete each old field value before typing in the new field
value.</p>
<h5 id="shared-credentials-for-a-small-group">Shared Credentials for a
Small Group</h5>
<p>This scenario assumes that a small group shares a common file of
account records with credentials that can only be decrypted using a
single shared password that is only known to the group. Because it is so
easy to manage, such simple setup it might be useful for a
<em>small</em> group that requires administrative access to a
<em>small</em> number of accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it involves sharing a password, this approach may be too
insecure for some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this approach is adopted, it would be wise to change the shared
password frequently, to audit all access to the shared file as well as
auditing all access to the accounts. Also, since the shared file
<em>must</em> be on a mounted volume that can be seen by the input file
dialogue, access to the mount and, by extension, to the file can also be
restricted.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to share the pam file.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the mounted volume.</li>
<li>Create the pam file and populate it with the shared records.
<ol type="1">
<li>Optionally, you may wish to limit the fields to <code>login</code>,
<code>password</code>, <code>note</code> and <code>host</code> by
editing the preferences and removing the other fields since these
records have a specific format.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Save the file to the mounted volume with a password.</li>
<li>Communicate the location of the file and the password to the members
of the group in a secure way.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="recipes">Recipes</h5>
<p>This is a bit of contrived example because you could easily keep all
of your recipes with your other personal account data but it might be
useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>The key notion here is the idea of creating two new fields in the
preference dialogue: <q>difficulty</q>, <q>ingredients</q> and
<q>steps</q>, and then using them when you enter recipes.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to get started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the preferences dialogue from the menu in pam.</li>
<li>Add the three new fields by clicking on the
<img src="./plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon
in the <q>Record Fields</q> section.
<ol type="1">
<li><q>difficulty</q> of type <q>text</q>.</li>
<li><q>ingredients</q> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
<li><q>steps</q> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete all of the other fields by clicking on the trashcan
<img src="./trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/>
icon.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search by an ingredient, set the <q>Search Record Field Values</q>
preference to true by clicking on it and then saving it.</p>
<h5 id="books">Books</h5>
<p>This is another somewhat of contrived example because you could
easily keep all of your book reviews with your other personal account
data but it might be useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>For my book reviews, I enter the book title as the record title and
added the following fields using the methodology described in the
recipes section above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that i only add records or books that i have completed.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>

<tr class="header">
<th>name</th>
<th>type</th>

<p>It is free and open-source (FOSS) software.</p>
<h5 id="release-pam">Release PAM</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the <code>VERSION</code> file using semantic versioning.</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to propagate the new version.</li>
<li>Run <code>make app-help</code> to propagate any changes to
<code>HELP.md</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>make web</code> to create <code>pam-www.tar</code> which
contains the app in <code>pam/www</code>. It can be used to release to a
secure (HTTPS) server. The app cannot be used on a non-secure (HTTP)
server because it requires a secure context.</li>
