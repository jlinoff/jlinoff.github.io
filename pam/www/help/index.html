<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> or Personal Account Manager is a free and open source
single page web application that runs in your browser in a secure
context that enables you to securely manage your confidential personal
account data as searchable records in a secure, flexible, and persistent
manner <em>without ever having to visit a server</em> because it stores
the data in a file that you control. The file is encrypted so even if it
were stolen the data would be safe <em>if the password you used to
encrypt it was strong</em>.</p>
<p>You can run the application locally, from your own server or from the
public github.io server <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>See the <em><a href="#security-considerations">Security
Considerations</a></em> and <em><a
href="#reasons-to-consider-using-pam">Reasons to consider using
PAM</a></em> sections below if you are interested in what motivated me
to write <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a pretty simple application. I think of it as a
record editor that runs in your browser that allows you create records
with interesting information that can then be stored and retrieved in a
secure way.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-not-use-pam">Reasons to not use PAM</h3>
<p>It is very reasonable to ask yourself why, if <em>PAM</em> is like an
editor, you can’t simply just use something like an Excel spreadsheet or
a text file editor or keep passwords on sheets of paper or use one of
the many commercially available password managers?</p>
<p>That is an excellent question. The answer is that you <em>can</em>
and, if you are already using an Excel spreadsheet or a text file editor
or a sheet of paper or a password management service or anything other
method that works well for you, <em>you should</em>.</p>
<p>Even if you do not already have a method for managing passwords
<em>PAM</em> may not be the right choice. <em>PAM</em> requires that you
understand a bit about HTML input and textarea elements which may be
confusing. Also the <em>PAM</em> user interface (UI) and record data
model may be confusing or hard to understand and use because I am not a
UI programmer.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I wrote <em>PAM</em> to provide some features
I wanted and to address some concerns I had with existing approaches.
Those features and concerns are discussed in the next section to help
you understand my reasoning so that you can decide whether any of them
are important to you. If you don’t care about the features and the
concerns that bother me, there is no reason to use this tool.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-consider-using-pam">Reasons to consider using
PAM</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, I wrote <em>PAM</em> provide
some features I wanted and to address some concerns I had with existing
approaches. This section lists those concerns and features in the each
of reasons presented below.</p>
<h4 id="reason-1-no-client-server-communications">Reason 1: No Client
Server Communications</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a single page web application (SPA) that has no
backend which means that it never communicates information with an
external site. This makes it safe from some cyber attacks as detailed in
the <a href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>
section.</p>
<h4 id="reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</h4>
<p>In <em>PAM</em>, information is organized into files composed of
records that each have a unique title and are, in turn, composed of
fields that each field have a name, a type and a value. This approach is
similar to organizing information using recipe cards or a rolodex.</p>
<p>Following the recipe card analogy a little further, we can say that
each recipe is a single record, a collection of recipes for desserts
would be a file of dessert recipe records where each record or recipe
had three sections or fields: a title (the name of the recipe), the
ingredients and the instructions. This is what a recipe record might
look like in <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae.png" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>As you can see, in this recipe record, the record title is
<code>"Ice Cream Sundae"</code> and the two fields <q>ingredients</q>
and <q>instructions</q> contain the multiline (<code>textarea</code>)
descriptions of what the ingredients and instructions are for this
specific recipe.</p>
<p>On the other hand a record for an account might have the url, the
login name and the password. Something like this:</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-account.png" alt="google-account-example"></p>
<p>In the acount example above, the record title is
<code>"Google"</code>, the url field value is
<code>"https://google.com"</code>, the login field value is
<code>"pbrain81@gmail.com"</code> and the password value is hidden.</p>
<p>As you can see both records look quite different. Recipes records
have fields for <q>ingredients</q> and <q>instructions</q> whereas
account records have fields for the <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and
<q>password</q>.</p>
<p>You could easily imagine defining other records that contain
information for other topics like <em><q>books read</q></em> or
<em><q>unidentified aerial phenomena</q></em> or <em><q>bird
watching</q></em> which would undoubtedly require additional, different
fields.</p>
<p>This demonstrates why <em>PAM</em> was organized around the notion of
records that are composed of flexible, user defined fields. In my view,
the record/field structure does a better job of representing this type
of topic data than a spreadsheet or a text file editor.</p>
<p>If the number of records plan to store is large like 10,000 recipes
or address information for mailing list, you probably want to use a
database not <em>PAM</em>.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is great for small collections not gargantuan ones. I
never store more than about 150 records which is probably a reasonable
upper bound but, in practice, <em>PAM</em> does not impose any
limits.</p>
<h4 id="reason-3-searching">Reason 3: Searching</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> allows you to search records by their title or their
field names and values to filter out records that do not match the
search pattern. This is extremely useful when the number of records
grows.</p>
<p>See <a href="#search-records">Search Records</a> for more
details.</p>
<h4 id="reason-4-automatic-password-generation">Reason 4: Automatic
Password Generation</h4>
<p>I always find it hard to come up with passwords in the spur of the
moment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <em>PAM</em> provides an automatic password generation
capability that I find really useful. Of course almost all browsers do
this as well these days, but they generate cryptic, hard to memorize
passwords which is perfectly fine if you never have to remember them but
if you want a more memorable password, you are out of luck.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> gives you a choice because it has the concept of cryptic
and memorable passwords as discussed in detail in <a
href="#password-fields">Password Fields</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="reason-5-file-based-storage">Reason 5: File Based Storage</h4>
<p><em>PAM</em> uses files to load and store the record data.</p>
<p>Using a file means that the user does not have to rely on the
cybersecurity defenses of a company running a web server at their site
or another third party site.</p>
<p>A <em>PAM</em> file is composed of a set of records. Any records you
like. You can use a single file for all of your records or you can have
multiple files where each file contains records that are somehow related
like records of <em><q>recipes</q></em> or <em><q>book reviews</q></em>
or <em><q>my favorite species of Euglena</q></em>.</p>
<p>For a discussion about how the user controls the organization of the
records and fields in a file see the <a
href="#reason-2-record-model">Reason 2: Record Model</a> sectionof this
document.</p>
<p>I store my record files in cloud <em>IaaS</em> storage
(infrastructure as a service) and mount that storage as a local volume
on each device so that the files look like they are local but they are,
in fact, stored in the cloud. That allows me to access the files from
any of my devices: laptops, phones and tablets.</p>
<p>I personally use iCloud because it does all the volume mount work
automatically on all of my devices.</p>
<h4 id="reason-6-record-field-customization">Reason 6: Record Field
Customization</h4>
<p>The record fields are fully customizable. The advantage of using a
record model to represent the data was discussed earlier (in reason 2)
but being able to change the basic building blocks of the record (the
record fields) extends the advantage of this approach.</p>
<p>For more information on fields see the <a href="#fields">Fields</a>
section.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> provides a set of pre-defined record fields in the <a
href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> but you can tailor them to your
needs as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-predefined-fields.png" alt="predefined-fields"></p>
<p>You can also change the names of the pre-defined fields when creating
a new record. They are only provided for convenience.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-change-field-name.png" alt="change-field-name"></p>
<h4 id="reason-7-secure-context-encryption">Reason 7: Secure Context
Encryption</h4>
<p>Records are encrypted using an NIST certified, strong, well defined,
standard symmetric encryption algorithm: <code>AES-256-CBC</code>. That
means, if a file is stolen, the record data is safe, if it has been
encrypted with a strong password.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, note that <code>AES-256-CBC</code> is thought to
be reasonably resistant to quantum attacks as discussed in the
literature. <a
href="#https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/6712/is-aes-256-a-post-quantum-secure-cipher-or-not">Here</a>
is one relevant exchange from a <code>crypto.stackexchange.com</code>
discussion.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> encryption and decryption operations are provided by and
run <em>in</em> the browser using the <em>secure context of the
browser</em>. This is the same context used for accessing sites securely
for transactions, like your bank.</p>
<p>The security of the <em>secure context</em> operations is taken very
seriously by organizations that develop Chrome, Edge, Firefox and other
browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a
href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="reason-8-hiding-passwords-from-causal-observers">Reason 8:
Hiding Passwords from Causal Observers</h4>
<p>Passwords and other secrets are automatically hidden on the screen
(displayed as asterisks) so that someone looking over your shoulder
cannot read them unless you choose to make them visible.</p>
<p>This is the default hidden view of a password.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-hidden.png" alt="password-hidden"></p>
<p>This is the view of a password when it is not hidden.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-shown.png" alt="password-shown"></p>
<h4 id="reason-9-access-from-mobile-devices">Reason 9: Access from
mobile devices</h4>
<p>The files can be accessed from mobile devices so the user has access
to the records anywhere. In addition it uses <a
href="#https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap-5</a>
to make it work better in mobile browsers.</p>
<h4 id="reason-10-foss">Reason 10: FOSS</h4>
<p>Last but not least, one the more compelling reasons to try
<em>PAM</em> is that it is free and open source software (FOSS). You can
try it and use it without any obligation or cost. You can also fix bugs
or customize it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em> is a simple single page web application (SPA). It
consists of three basic parts: the menu and search section, the records
section and the status section.</p>
<p>It looks something like this</p>
<p><img src="./pam-basic-sections.png" alt="menu-bar"></p>
<h3 id="menu-and-search-section">Menu and Search Section</h3>
<p>The top section that contains a search input and a menu.</p>
<p>The search input is used to find records that match the input to make
them easier to find.</p>
<p>The menu at the top right is the control center for the application
it has a number of options as you can see below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-basic-menu.png" alt="menu"></p>
<h3 id="records-section">Records Section</h3>
<p>Underneath the top level bar is the records section. Each record is
shown as entry that is displayed by its title. If you click or tap on
it, it will expand. This is called an accordion display and is shown
below with the <q>Facebook</q> entry expanded.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>As you can see the expanded <q>Facebook</q> record has three fields:
<q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can copy the field values to the clipboard so that they can be
pasted into login forms. The copy works for passwords whether the
password is visible or not.</p>
<p>You also delete, clone or edit the records:</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields2.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can also click or tap on the title of the opened record to close
it.</p>
<h3 id="status-section">Status Section</h3>
<p>Below the records section is the section where ephemeral status
messages are displayed (they disappear after about 1.5 seconds).</p>
<p>The status messages are used to provide activity feedback like
showing how many bytes were copied to a clipboard when a copy button is
clicked or tapped as shown in the example below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-status-msg.png" alt="status-message"></p>
<p>You can control the duration of the messages in the preferences.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>The following sections will go over the basic functions that
<em>PAM</em> provides.</p>
<p>In a nutshell they are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>About - Display information about the application.</li>
<li>Create Record</li>
<li>Edit Record</li>
<li>Delete Record</li>
<li>Clone Record</li>
<li>Save File - save records to an encrypted file.</li>
<li>Load File - load a collection of records from an encrypted
file.</li>
<li>Search Records</li>
<li>Get Help</li>
</ol>
<p>Each function will be discussed in a separate subsection.</p>
<p>Note that Preferences were not included because they have their own
top level section in this document.</p>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Click or tap on the <q>About</q> menu entry to get information about
<em>PAM</em>. You can even add custom HTML through the preferences.</p>
<p>Here is a screen shot of what you would see.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about.png" alt="about"></p>
<p>Here is the annotated view</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-annotated.png" alt="about-annotated"></p>
<p>Here is an about dialogue with custom message.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-custom.png" alt="about-custom"></p>
<p>Custom messages are defined in preferences as follows.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-about-custom-pref.png" alt="about-custom-pref"></p>
<h3 id="create-record">Create Record</h3>
<p>This is a long section because it covers a number of concepts that
are needed by other sections like topic and fields.</p>
<p>Creating a record is a very common activity in <em>PAM</em> so I
tried to make it as easy as possible.</p>
<p>There are three ways to create record:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A record can be created in the application by clicking or tapping
the <q>New Record</q> menu option,</li>
<li>A record can be created in the application by cloning an existing
record or</li>
<li>A record can be created outside of the application by editing
javascript.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three approaches will be discussed here with examples.</p>
<p>Creating the record by clicking or tapping the <q>New Record</q> menu
option in the application is probably the best way to create the first
new record for a topic family. This is also known as the <q>menu</q>
approach.</p>
<p>Creating a record by cloning an existing record in the application is
useful when you want to use the same fields as the existing record. It
is a great way to guarantee uniformity. Although if the number of fields
is small using the <q>menu</q> approach is also fine.</p>
<p>Creating a record by editing javascript is most useful if you are
interested in creating record programmatically (perhaps a subset of
accounts that shared with a small group of users).</p>
<p>Before any of the creation approaches can be discussed it is very
important to understands record topics and record fields to provide
background information for understanding some of the terms.</p>
<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>
<p>Topics are a way of organizing records that have similar fields.
Topics are arbitrary. For example, a topic could be something like
<q>recipes</q>, <q>accounts</q>, or <q>unidentified aerial
phenomena</q>.</p>
<p>One way to use topics is to define a file all records in that topic.
For example you could have a <q><code>recipe.pam</code></q> file for all
of your recipe records or you could put all of your records,
irregardless of topic, into a single file like
<q><code>mystuff.pam</code></q>.</p>
<h4 id="fields">Fields</h4>
<p>Records are composed of fields. Before creating a new record make
sure that you know exactly what fields you want to use but before you
can do that you need to understand how they are defined.</p>
<p>Each field has a name, a type and a value.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I decided to bind the field name and type so
that the field name unambiguously defines the type. That means that a
field like <code>"login"</code> is always a <code>"text"</code> field.
It will never be a phone number or a date.</p>
<p>Fields are defined in <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> and they
are stored in each file with the along with the records. Here is what
they are by default.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-predefined-fields.png" alt="predefined-fields"></p>
<p>You can change them at any time. Because the fields are stored in
each file they can be different for each topic file, if you choose to
organize things that way.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is very flexible so it doesn’t impose any strict rules
on the fields. Thus, you can also change the names of the pre-defined
fields when creating a new record. They are only provided for
convenience.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-change-field-name.png" alt="change-field-name"></p>
<p>The field types are based on HTML element input types and that is, in
fact, how they are presented to the user in the preferences dialogue.
Here is a brief overview of the types and when to use them. You can
search the web for more details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember that the types were not made up by me, they were taken
directly from input element description <a
href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input">here</a>,
the separate textarea element is described <a
href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is oftentimes the case that all of the types are not needed. This
is especially true for well cases where you have a very clear
understanding record field requirements. If that is the case you might
want to use the preferences to delete fields that are not relevant for
your usage (you can always add them back later if you want).</p>
<p>Here is an example that shows a recipe record with <q>ingredients</q>
and <q>instructions</q> fields.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-ice-cream-sundae.png" alt="ice-cream-sundae-example"></p>
<p>Here is an example that shows an account record with <q>url</q>,
<q>login</q> and <q>password</q> fields.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-google-account.png" alt="google-account-example"></p>
<h4 id="password-fields">Password Fields</h4>
<p>Passwords fields show up in a lot of places. I chose to document them
here because you will probably first encounter them when creating a
record.</p>
<p>Password fields are a special case for the following three
reasons.</p>
<p>First, they provide a generator that allows you to automatically
create passwords at the click or tap of a button. For information about
preferences that can be used to customize password generation see <a
href="#password-preferences">Password Preferences</a></p>
<p>Second, they always hide the value so that it can be seen by someone
observing your screen.</p>
<p>And, finally, because they provide the ability to generate two
different types of passwords: cryptic and memorable.</p>
<h5 id="cryptic-passwords">Cryptic Passwords</h5>
<p>Cryptic passwords consist of letters, digits and special characters
in a single string.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <code>'N5yAb!XfGa3vELPsK95K4/AAz8mts'</code>.</p>
<p>Cryptic passwords tend to be hard to memorize for most people.</p>
<h5 id="memorable-passwords">Memorable Passwords</h5>
<p>Memorable passwords are composed of lower case English words with an
optional prefix, an optional separator between each word and an optional
suffix.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>.</p>
<p>Memorable passwords tend to be easier to memorize than cryptic
passwords for most people.</p>
<h5 id="hidden-password-representation">Hidden Password
Representation</h5>
<p>Here is an example that shows a password in its standard hidden
form.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-fields.png" alt="record-expanded"></p>
<p>To make the password visible, click or tap on the
<img src="./eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon.</p>
<h5 id="visible-password-representation">Visible Password
Representation</h5>
<p>Here is an example that shows a password in its visible hidden
form.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-record-expanded-password.png" alt="record-expanded-password"></p>
<p>To hide the password, click or tap on the
<img src="./eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/> icon.</p>
<h5 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h5>
<p>This is what the password field dialogue looks like with no
generator.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-no-generator.png" alt="password-no-generator"></p>
<p>When you click or tap on the
<img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon, cryptic and
memorable passwords are generated and the password generator dialogue
appears.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-generator.png" alt="password-generator"></p>
<p>As you can see it always generates five memorable passwords to
provide some choices. I found that more useful than the original
implementation which only had a single choice. The decision to present 5
was arbitrary but it seems to work well enough for my needs.</p>
<p>This is what the password generator looks like with annotations.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-password-generator-annotated.png" alt="password-generator-annotated"></p>
<p>If you click or tap on the
<img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon a second time, new
passwords will be generated. You must click or tap on the
<img src='./x-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon to close the
dialogue. I chose this non-intuitive approach was chosen because I
wanted the <img src='./gear.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon to be
used to generate new passwords. That may not have been the most
intuitive way to implement it but it works well enough.</p>
<p>To choose a password simply click or tap on it and it will be added
to the field value.</p>
<h4 id="menu-approach">Menu Approach</h4>
<p>Click or tap on the <code>"New Record"</code> option from the
menu.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-menu.png" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>That will popup a dialogue that looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record.png" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>You can now type in the record title.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-new-record-title.png" alt="new-record"></p>
<p>From there you click or tap on the <code>"Type"</code> pulldown to
select and create the first record field. Don’t worry if you select the
wrong one, they are easy to delete.</p>
<p>For this example we will choose <q>note</q> because it is a
<q>textarea</q> field and then rename it to <q>ingredients</q> and type
in some basic ingredients in the value input.</p>
<p>Here is where you select <q>note</q> for the first field.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-field-1-select.png" alt="new-record-field-1-select"></p>
<p>And then change the field name to <q>ingredients</q> and populate
it.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-field-1.png" alt="new-record-field-1"></p>
<p>Now do the same thing to create a <q>instructions</q> field. Remember
to choose <q>note</q> just like in the previous step. This is what it
looks like after you have added the second field.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-field-2.png" alt="new-record-field-2"></p>
<p>One interesting thing to note is that you can <em>change the order of
the fields</em> by dragging them up or down. To do that select the field
title at the top of the box (fieldset) and move it. Here is what it
looks like when i dragged instructions up.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-drag.png" alt="new-record-drag"></p>
<p>I then dragged instructions back down because it should appear after
ingredients.</p>
<p>When you are finished click or tap on the <code>"Save"</code> button
to save it and you will see it show up as a new record.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-done.png" alt="new-record-done"></p>
<p>You can click or tap on the record to expand it and see the fields
you just defined.</p>
<p><img src="pam-new-record-done-expand.png" alt="new-record-done-expand"></p>
<h4 id="clone-approach">Clone Approach</h4>
<p>Cloning a record is simple. Just expand the record and click or tap
on the clone button and an edit dialogue pops up.</p>
<p>Using the record that was created in the previous section here is
what happens when you click or tap the <code>"Clone"</code> button.</p>
<p><img src="pam-clone-record-popup.png" alt="clone-record-popup"></p>
<p>At this point you would typically change the title and field values
but for this demonstration will not do anything. <em>PAM</em> makes sure
that the title is unique so it can be saved.</p>
<p>Click or tap the <code>"Save"</code> button and you will see
this.</p>
<p><img src="pam-clone-records-1.png" alt="clone-records-1"></p>
<p>As you can see, <em>PAM</em> still remembers that you had the
original record open. That is so that it is easy to continue clicking or
tapping the <code>"Clone"</code> button to create more records. In this
case we only care about one record so you can click or tap on the new
record to expand it.</p>
<p><img src="pam-clone-records-2.png" alt="clone-records-1"></p>
<h4 id="javascript-approach">Javascript Approach</h4>
<p>This approach is not going to have any screenshots because it deals
with <em>PAM</em> internals and may change from time to time. Instead a
set of instructions is provided that should allows you to figure it out
pretty easily.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create one record using the menu approach.</li>
<li>Save the record to a file <em>without a password</em>. Normally this
is a very bad idea because it could expose your data to a hacker so take
precautions to protect the file.</li>
<li>Look the <q>records</q> section of the file and use that as a
template to create more records.</li>
<li>When you have added the records, load the file.</li>
<li>Then save it again <em>with a password</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason that this has to be done without a password is because I
have not yet written a command line utility to encrypt/decrypt the
files. It should be straightforward to do because it uses the standard
<code>"AWS_256-CBC"</code> algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="edit-record">Edit Record</h3>
<p>To edit a record, select it from the records list and click or tap on
the <code>"Edit"</code> button to popup the edit dialogue <em>which is
exactly the same</em> as the dialogue used to create record.</p>
<p>In fact, it is implemented using the <em>same code</em> so you can
use the instructions from the <a href="#create-record">Create Record</a>
section to change or add new fields.</p>
<h3 id="delete-record">Delete Record</h3>
<p>To delete a record, select it from the records list and click or tap
on the <code>"Delete"</code> button.</p>
<p><em>Beware</em> that <em>PAM</em> trusts you and will not ask you if
you <em>really</em> want to delete the record, it will just go ahead and
do it so be careful.</p>
<h3 id="clone-record">Clone Record</h3>
<p>To clone a record, select it from the records list and click or tap
on the <code>"Clone"</code> button. This will create a new record that
you can edit.</p>
<p>The clone operation is described in detail in the <a
href="#create-record">Create Record</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="save-file">Save File</h3>
<p>To save records and preferences to a file by choose the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-down-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Save
File</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section
to see screenshots.</p>
<p>If you want the records encrypted, enter or generate a password. Make
sure that you do not forget this password. It is the <em>master</em>
password this is used to unlock all of the records and <em>PAM</em> does
<em>not</em> keep track of it. That means that if the password is lost,
<em>PAM</em> cannot recover the data it is lost forever.</p>
<p>Encryption is done using the <code>"AWS-CBC-256"</code> encryption
algorithm which is known to be secure (even to quantum attacks) but it
means that you must remember it because the file records cannot be
retrieved if the password is lost.</p>
<p>If you do not enter a password, the output will javascript which can
be read by anyone. It is <em>NOT</em> secure. If you have records with
passwords <em>ALWAYS</em> use a password unless you understand the
consquences. This can sometimes be convenient because it allows you to
see how the <em>PAM</em> data is organized which can aid automation.</p>
<h3 id="load-file">Load File</h3>
<p>To load records and preferences to a file by choose the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-up-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Load
File</q> option from the menu. See the <a href="#menu">Menu</a> section
to see screenshots.</p>
<p>If the file was saved with a password, you must enter that password
or the file will not load.</p>
<h3 id="search-records">Search Records</h3>
<p><em>PAM</em> allows you to search records by their title or their
field names and values to filter out records that do not match the
search pattern. This is extremely useful when the number of records
grows.</p>
<p>The search function supports case insensitive searches and regular
expressions to make it easier to find stuff.</p>
<p>I use this a lot for finding things like where i am still using old
passwords and obsolete accounts or even something like all of the
recipes that reference vanilla ice cream.</p>
<p>Here is an made up list of accounts:</p>
<p><img src="./pam-search.png" alt="pam-search"></p>
<p>Here is the same list after filtering for those whose titles contain
the letter <code>"g"</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-search-g.png" alt="pam-search-g"></p>
<p>To filter only those that start with <code>"g"</code> you would use
this regular expression search term instead: <code>"^g"</code>.</p>
<p>For more information about regular expression syntax see the
documentation for <a
href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">Javascript
Regular Expressions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="get-help">Get Help</h3>
<p>To get this help message, choose the <code>"Help"</code> option from
the menu.</p>
<p>If you find a bug or want to request a change or submit an
improvement, got <a href="#pam---personal-account-manager">Metadata
section</a> at the top of file click or tap on the project link.</p>
<h2 id="menu">Menu</h2>
<p>The menu is the control center for the app. It provides the basic
operations for creating records, loading records, saving them and it
provide information about the app including this help.</p>
<p>Note that much of this material has been discussed in earlier
sections but having it consolidated here might be helpful. Plus there
are links to the sections with relevant details.</p>
<p>This is what the menu looks like.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-menu.png" alt="menu"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are seven menu options: <q>About</q>,
<q>Preferences</q>, <q>New Record</q>, <q>Clear Records</q>, <q>Load
File</q>, <q>Save File</q>, and <q>Help</q>.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./info-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> About</q>
entry to see information about the app. See the <a
href="#about">About</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./gear.svg' height=' 32' width='32' /> Preferences</q>
entry to see the preferences dialogue which allows you to customize some
of the app behavior. There is a lot of stuff so you might want to read
the <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a> section before trying it.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./plus-circle-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> New
Record</q> entry to create a new record. See the <a
href="#create-record">Create Record</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./trash3-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clear
Records</q> entry to delete all of the records. This is useful for times
when you want to create a new collection of records that is saved in a
separate file. For example, if you wanted to create a collection
personal accounts in one file and a collection shared accounts for a
group of folks (like a development team sharing AWS accounts).</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-up-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Load
File</q> entry to load a records file. See the <a href="#load-file">Load
File</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./file-arrow-down-fill.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Save
File</q> entry to save all of the records to a file. See the <a
href="#save-file">Save File</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>Click or tap on the
<q><img src='./question-circle.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Help</q>
entry to see this help message.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h2 id="records">Records</h2>
<p>This section talks about how records are presented in <em>PAM</em>
using an example with seven records that contain confidential
information for <q>Amazon</q>, <q>Email</q>, <q>Facebook</q>,
<q>Github</q>, <q>Google</q>, <q>Netflix</q> and <q>Stack Exchange</q>
fictional accounts.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#create-record">Create Record</a> section for
details about how to create records.</p>
<h3 id="unexpanded-view-of-all-records">Unexpanded View of all
Records</h3>
<p>We start with the unexpanded view of all records as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-example-records.png" alt="example-records"></p>
<p>As you can see <em>PAM</em> presents the records as an accordion.
Each record is one entry in the accordion that you can expand to view
the record fields or <a href="#delete-record">delete</a>, <a
href="#clone-record">clone</a> or <a href="#edit-record">edit</a> edit
the record.</p>
<p>To get the information for an account you click or tap the
button.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen is the search bar and, at the far right, the
menu.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is a status bar that shows status
messages.</p>
<h3 id="expanded-view-of-a-record">Expanded View of a Record</h3>
<p>Once you click on or tap a record it expands as shown below where the
<q>Facebook</q> record was tapped.</p>
<p><img src="./pam-example-record-expanded.png" alt="example-record-expanded"></p>
<p>You can see that there are three fields in the record: <q>url</q>,
<q>login</q> and <q>password</q>, next to each field there is a icon
that looks like a clipboard
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/>. If
you click or tap it the field contents will be copied to the clipboard
so that you can paste them into a login dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the fields are completely customizable. You can have as
many as you want. Fields are added, modified and deleted by the
<q>Edit</q> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the cliboard icon there is another icon that looks
like an eye <img src="./eye.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye"/>.
that shows up for password field. If you click or tap it, the password
will be shown in plaintext and the icon will change to an eye with a
slash through it
<img src="./eye-slash.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="eye-slash"/>. By
default all passwords are hidden so that they are not visible to casual
observers. Click or tap it again to re-hide the password.</p>
<p>In addition there are three buttons at the bottom
<q><img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Delete</q> to delete
the record,
<q><img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Clone</q> to clone
the record and
<q><img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> Edit</q> to
edit the record fields.</p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences allow you to customized the behavior of the app. The
defaults are set so that most people will never have to change
anything.</p>
<p>The preferences dialogue is a big one. It is broken into 4
sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Search - preferences that control searches.</li>
<li>Passwords - preferences that control password creation and
length.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous - preferences for other stuff.</li>
<li>Record Fields - the definitions of the available fields.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each preference is discussed in more detail in the subsections
below.</p>
<h3 id="search-preferences">Search Preferences</h3>
<p>These preferences control search options.</p>
<h4 id="case-insensitive-searches">Case Insensitive Searches</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches are case insensitive, otherwise they are
case sensitive.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-titles">Search Record Titles</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record titles, otherwise they do
not.</p>
<p>The default is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-field-names">Search Record Field Names</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field names, otherwise
they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that
contained a specific field.</p>
<h4 id="search-record-field-values">Search Record Field Values</h4>
<p>If enabled, all searches look at the record field values, otherwise
they do not.</p>
<p>The default is not enabled.</p>
<p>You would want to enable this you wanted to see records that
contained a specific field value like an obsolete email or really old
password.</p>
<h3 id="password-preferences">Password Preferences</h3>
<p>These preferences control automatic password creation.</p>
<p>For more information about passwords see <a
href="#password-fields">Password Fields</a></p>
<h4 id="minimum-password-length">Minimum Password Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable
passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 12.</p>
<p>I would recommend not making it shorter than the default unless a
website specifically demands it because shorter passwords are easier to
crack.</p>
<h4 id="maximum-password-length">Maximum Password Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum length of generated cryptic and memorable
passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 32.</p>
<p>I would recommend making it longer than the default if you can but
many websites have an upper bound for the length of password. The chosen
default seems to work for most of them.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-min-word-length">Memorable Password Min Word
Length</h4>
<p>Defines the minimum size of a word in a generated memorable password.
&gt; It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
<p>The default is 2.</p>
<p>If you do not want short words like <code>'as'</code> or
<code>'it'</code>, then make this longer. I would not recommend making
it shorter.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-word-separator">Memorable Password Word
Separator</h4>
<p>The string used to separate the words in a generated memorable
password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is a single character: <code>'/'</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the character, add any string that you like. It
can be multiple characters. Other reasonable choices might be
<code>':'</code> or <code>'.'</code> or <code>'@@'</code> or whatever
you like. It is best not to use letters.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-min-words">Memorable Password Min Words</h4>
<p>The minimum number of words in a generated memorable password.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 3.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-max-tries">Memorable Password Max Tries</h4>
<p>The maximum number of attempts to generate a memorable password that
meets the specified criteria from the other password preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has no affect on cryptic passwords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default is 10000.</p>
<p>There is normally no need to ever change this but, if you change it
and make it too small, <em>PAM</em> will report errors if it fails to
generate passwords after the maximum number of tries.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-prefix">Memorable Password Prefix</h4>
<p>The prefix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the
generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper
case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'A1!!/'</code> to
meet the criteria which might create passwords like
<code>'A1!!/html/wishes/combined'</code> or
<code>'A1!!/rebates/restructuring/jamaica'</code>.</p>
<h4 id="memorable-password-suffix">Memorable Password Suffix</h4>
<p>The suffix to add to all generated memorable passwords.</p>
<p>The default is <code>''</code> (empty string).</p>
<p>You might want to add a prefix or suffix to make sure that the
generated passwords meet the requirements of websites that require upper
case letter, digits and special characters.</p>
<p>For example, you might specify something like <code>'/A1!!'</code> to
meet the criteria which might create passwords like
<code>'html/wishes/combined/A1!!'</code> or
<code>'rebates/restructuring/jamaica/A1!!'</code>.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-preferences">Miscellaneous Preferences</h3>
<p>These are the preferences did’t fall into the other categories.</p>
<h4 id="log-status-to-the-console">Log Status to the Console</h4>
<p>Log status messages to the console as well as the screen to aid
debugging.</p>
<p>The default is false which says do not log status messages to the
console.</p>
<p>You might want to enable console logging if you are debugging a
problem and are working in a browser that supports debugging.</p>
<h4 id="clear-records-on-load">Clear Records On Load</h4>
<p>Clear all records before loading records from a file.</p>
<p>The default is true which says to clear the records before a loading
new records from a file.</p>
<p>If you set this to false, another option titled <q>Load Duplicate
Record Strategy</q> will appear that is not normally visible to ask you
with strategy you want to used for conflicts.</p>
<p>You might set this preference to false if you want to to merge sets
of records from different files.</p>
<h4 id="load-duplicate-record-strategy">Load Duplicate Record
Strategy</h4>
<p>This preference is not visible unless the <q>Clear Records On
Load</q> preference is false.</p>
<p>It presents three strategies for handling duplicate records during a
load operation: <q>allow</q>, <q>ignore</q>, <q>replace</q>.</p>
<p>The <q>allow</q> strategy allows duplicate records to exist by
cloning them. For example if a record with the title <q>Google</q>
exists in the records and in the file being loaded, the record from the
file would be renamed to <q>Google Clone</q>.</p>
<p>The <q>ignore</q> strategy ignores the duplicate record that is being
loaded. If there is a conflict it prefers the one already present.</p>
<p>The <q>replace</q> strategy ignores the duplicate record that already
exists. If there is a conflict it prefers the record being loaded.</p>
<h4 id="clone-field-values-when-cloning-records">Clone Field Values when
Cloning Records</h4>
<p>This preference specifies that all data is kept when cloning a
record.</p>
<p>Remember that cloning a record is very simple and powerful way to
create records with the same fields but you have to delete the existing
values before entering new ones which is very simple.</p>
<p>The default is false which says to keep the field values when
cloning.</p>
<p>Set this preference if you want to avoid deleting the fields
manually.</p>
<h4 id="custom-about">Custom About</h4>
<p>Customized HTML that is added to the about page. It can be used in
cases where the field records have been customized to provide an
explanation or link to internal documentation.</p>
<h3 id="record-fields">Record Fields</h3>
<p>These are the pre-defined record fields that are used when creating
or editing records. They can be overridden.</p>
<h3 id="todo-finish-up-preferences">TODO: finish up preferences</h3>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p><em>PAM</em>, like all web applications, has security challenges. By
fully disclosing them here you can understand the challenges and improve
your ability to protect your record data.</p>
<h3 id="mitm">MITM</h3>
<p>MITM refers to <q>Monster In The Middle</q> attacks or, historically,
<q>Man In The Middle</q> attacks. It an attack where a hostile
eavesdropper inserts themselves in the communications stream between a
client and a server to capture or alter the communications for nefarious
purposes like stealing credentials.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em> is not susceptible to this attack because it <em>does
not communicate with a server</em>. That is because it is a single page
web application that is downloaded and run within your browser. All data
is local. Nothing is ever transferred over the internet for an
eavesdropper to capture.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-web-site-security">Third Party Web Site
Security</h3>
<p>Third party web site security can be a major source of cybersecurity
vulnerabilities because clients cannot know how well such cybersecurity
vulnerabilities are mitigated unless that site publishes a detailed
report, on a periodic basis, of how often they were attacked
successfully and how many attacks they have successfully fended off.</p>
<p>Sadly, most companies do not provide that information. If you are
using a password manager or any other service that uses a server, you
might want to consider asking them how vulnerable they are to
cyberattacks. At a minimum, you will want to understand what is done to
protect your data from insider attacks where an employee steals the
data.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can get associated information about the security of a
site by looking at Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) reports. See
<a href="https://www.cve.org/">https://www.cve.org/</a> for more
information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor reporting of third party web site cybersecurity vulnerabilities
and exposures is what motivated me to write <em>PAM</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because <em>PAM</em> does not send the data to a server, it is not
vulnerable to how cybersecurity is managed on the server by a third
party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is not sending data out by
monitoring outbound traffic from your system. <em>PAM</em> never sends
any outbound data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, encryption and decryption is run <em>inside</em> the browser
using the <em>secure context of the browser</em>. This is the same
context used for accessing sites securely for transactions, like your
bank. The security of the <em>secure context</em> is taken very
seriously by organizations that develop Chrome, Edge, Firefox and other
browsers.</p>
<p>You can read more about secure contexts <a
href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="site-reliability">Site Reliability</h3>
<p>Although it is not an attack vector <em>per se</em>, site reliability
is another consideration when choosing a web application because a
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the site or a power
failure at the site could make it unusable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most modern web applications are built using commercial
cloud software as a service (SaaS) products from vendors like Azure, GCP
and AWS so they tend to be <em>very</em> reliable but it is still
something to be aware of because if the site goes down so does the web
application.</p>
<p><em>PAM</em>, is hosted and served from <em>github.io</em> which also
appears to be very reliable but if you are concerned, you can host it
wherever you like. Also <em>PAM</em> does not do any backend server
communication (as mentioned earlier) to it will like continue to run
even if the site goes down temporarily because, once it is loaded, it
will stay resident until you close the browser tab.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is where you store your records file. I use
iCloud which is also quite reliable and allows acess to iCloud files
directly from computers mobile devices or tablets.</p>
<p>Just make sure that whichever infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
offering you choose it is reliable as well because you don’t want to
lose access to your file because the IaaS service is not available. Of
course, you could simply load and save the data to a local file but that
would restrict access to it from other devices (like mobile phones or
tables) and you have to be very diligent about keeping it backed up.</p>
<h3 id="over-the-shoulder-surfing-attack">Over the Shoulder Surfing
Attack</h3>
<p>The user enters the record data in decrypted form, so it may be
vulnerable to over the shoulder surfing attacks where someone or
something (like a camera) watches or films the user typing or opening a
record and then clicking or tapping on a password field to display the
password in plaintext which could allow that information to be
stolen.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be mitigated by being aware of your
surroundings to make sure you are not being watched or filmed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is different and easier to mitigate than <q>key-logging and
screen recording</q> as discussed in the next subsection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="malware-key-logging-and-screen-recording">Malware: Key Logging
and Screen Recording</h3>
<p>If malware that takes screenshots or does key logging has been
installed on your computer, phone or tablet, you are in trouble for a
variety of reasons. It means that an attacker can see what you are doing
and capture what you are typing.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate these forms of attacks is to keep your
system up to date by installing security patches and by using some sort
of security tool or tools to protect your system.</p>
<h3 id="malware-clipboard-attack">Malware: Clipboard Attack</h3>
<p>Yet another type of vulnerability is the <q>clipboard attack</q>
if/when data is copied to the clipboard for cut and paste operations.
This vulnerability exists because the clipboard is a global resource
that can be accessed by other, independent applications.</p>
<p>Clipboard attacks can be mitigated by making sure that your computer
does not have malware installed or by not copying to the clipboard.
Although it is probably impractical to not use the clipboard at all so,
if you do use the clipboard, make sure that you always reset it after
any copy/paste operation to minimize any chances that it will be
captured by malware or observed by an attacker. You can reset it by
simply selection a single letter or word and copying it.</p>
<p>Another, perhaps better, way to mitigate the clipboard vulnerability
would be to eliminate the need for the clipboard by modifying
<em>PAM</em> to automatically login in for you based on record data
using an HTTP POST operation but that is not currently available.</p>
<h3 id="unattended-browser">Unattended Browser</h3>
<p>If you leave the browser unattended after you have loaded your record
data, someone can sit down and see the records because they are
impersonating you <em>after you have logged in</em>.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate this attach is to always lock your screen
when you leave the computer unattended.</p>
<h3 id="website-spoofing">Website Spoofing</h3>
<p>Web site spoofing could be used to direct you to a website that could
be used to steal your information using a look alike web
application.</p>
<p>To mitigate that make sure that you accessing the <em>PAM</em> from a
known, trusted site.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about this, you can always download, build and
run <em>PAM</em> from your own site.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting Yourself</h3>
<p>In summary, security can never be fully guaranteed, the best way to
protect your data is to follow commonly recommended security
practices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep all of your security patches up to date.</li>
<li>Keep malware off of your systems.</li>
<li>Make sure that you are not observed.</li>
<li>Never share sensitive information (like passwords).</li>
<li>Backup your data.</li>
<li>Use a strong password for encrypting your files.
<ol type="1">
<li>It should be at least 20 characters.</li>
<li>It should not contain personally identifiable information like
dates.</li>
<li>It should be memorable and fairly easy to type.</li>
<li>I suggest using a memorable password of length 30 or more that
contains 3 to 5 words with a custom prefix and suffix. Perhaps something
with a structure like this:
<q><code>A1/jeans/chosen/since/tuition?!!</code></q> (do NOT use this
specific password!).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Make sure that the website URL is what you expect.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multi-factor-authentication">Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>Several folks have asked me why Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was
not included in <em>PAM</em> to provide and additional layer of
security.</p>
<p>In general the MFA approach assumes that the users identity must be
checked and validated (authentication) so that the site offering the
services knows that it is dealing with the valid user not an
impersonator <em>which is a great thing</em> but it is not necessary for
<em>PAM</em> because <em>PAM</em> has no <em>site</em>. It is a single
page web application which, once it is loaded, makes it more like a
local word processor that is tailored to managing customized records in
<em>local</em> files so any additional communication over the internet
represents a risk as does storing any user information. Everything is
done inside the browser in a secure context.</p>
<p>No outbound information is ever sent to the internet unless the user
specifically requests it via the <code>Load File</code> and
<code>Save File</code> operations but at that point all data is
encrypted both at the file level and as the HTTPS transport level which
is required for the browser secure context which, in turn, is required
by <em>PAM</em> to function which is pretty safe if you protect your
data with a strong password.</p>
<p>You can verify that <em>PAM</em> is functioning securely by
monitoring outbound internet traffic. You should never see any outbound
traffic from <em>PAM</em> that is not related to the file load and save
operations.</p>
<h2 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h2>
<p>The examples in this section talk about how to use this app under
different scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="personal-account-records">Personal Account Records</h3>
<p>This is the most common usage. It is where personal account records
are stored so that you have a permanent, encrypted record of all of your
passwords.</p>
<h4 id="create-record-and-file">Create Record and File</h4>
<p>To create a file and a record follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app: <a
href="https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/">https://jlinoff.github.io/pam/www/</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>Or to wherever you installed it, if you built it locally.</li>
<li>This can be done from any device, like your phone, tablet or
computer but you must have access to cloud storage (on iphone and ipads
that would be iCloud).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Select the <q>Add New Record</q> option from the menu in the upper
right hand corner.</li>
<li>When the new record dialogue pops up, enter the account name as the
title, an example might be <q>Google email</q>.</li>
<li>Add fields like <q>url</q>, <q>login</q> and <q>password</q>.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>At this point it will appear as your first record on the
display.</li>
<li>Now save it to a file by selecting <q>Save File</q> from the
menu.</li>
<li>Enter the file name, perhaps something like <q>mystuff.pam</q> or
<q>joe.pam</q> if your name is <q>Joe</q>,</li>
<li>Enter a password.
<ol type="1">
<li>This is the password that you need to access all of the records in
the file.</li>
<li>The password is <em>not</em> stored so make sure that you keep track
of it somewhere because if it is lost, the records <em>cannot</em> be
retrieved.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your data is stored. You can add as many additional
records as you want or change existing records. As long as you save
them, they will be available to you.</p>
<h4 id="use-record-data-to-log-into-a-site">Use Record Data to Log into
a Site</h4>
<p>To use the data to log into a site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the <q>url</q> link so that the site opens up in a
different tab.</li>
<li>Enter the login name or email by clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the login name and paste into the site.</li>
<li>Enter the password by clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./clipboard.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="clipboard"/> icon
next to the password and paste into the site.
<ol type="1">
<li>You do <em>not</em> need to make the password visible to do
this.</li>
<li>It picks up the correct password even when it is hidden.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="edit-an-existing-record">Edit an Existing Record</h3>
<p>To edit an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the edit
<img src='./pencil-square.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to make the necessary changes to the fields or
title.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="delete-an-existing-record">Delete an Existing Record</h4>
<p>To delete an existing record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the delete
<img src='./trash.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="clone-an-existing-record">Clone an Existing Record</h4>
<p>This is a really powerful operation that allows you to quickly create
records with the same fields.</p>
<p>To clone a record.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the app as described above.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the record that contains the information.</li>
<li>Click or tap on the edit
<img src='./files.svg' height='32' width='32' /> icon.</li>
<li>Edit the record to update the fields.</li>
<li>Save the record.</li>
<li>Make sure to save the file when you are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to disable the copying of field data turn off the
<q>Clone Field Values when Cloning Records</q> preference. That avoids
having to delete each old field value before typing in the new field
value.</p>
<h3 id="shared-credentials-for-a-small-group">Shared Credentials for a
Small Group</h3>
<p>This scenario assumes that a small group shares a common file of
account records with credentials that can only be decrypted using a
single shared password that is only known to the group. Because it is so
easy to manage, such simple setup it might be useful for a
<em>small</em> group that requires administrative access to a
<em>small</em> number of accounts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it involves sharing a password, this approach may be too
insecure for some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this approach is adopted, it would be wise to change the shared
password frequently, to audit all access to the shared file as well as
auditing all access to the accounts. Also, since the shared file
<em>must</em> be on a mounted volume that can be seen by the input file
dialogue, access to the mount and, by extension, to the file can also be
restricted.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to share the pam file.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the mounted volume.</li>
<li>Create the pam file and populate it with the shared records.
<ol type="1">
<li>Optionally, you may wish to limit the fields to <code>login</code>,
<code>password</code>, <code>note</code> and <code>host</code> by
editing the preferences and removing the other fields since these
records have a specific format.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Save the file to the mounted volume with a password.</li>
<li>Communicate the location of the file and the password to the members
of the group in a secure way.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recipes">Recipes</h3>
<p>This is a bit of contrived example because you could easily keep all
of your recipes with your other personal account data but it might be
useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>The key notion here is the idea of creating two new fields in the
preference dialogue: <q>difficulty</q>, <q>ingredients</q> and
<q>steps</q>, and then using them when you enter recipes.</p>
<p>Here are the high level steps necessary to get started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the preferences dialogue from the menu in pam.</li>
<li>Add the three new fields by clicking or tapping on the
<img src="./plus-circle.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/> icon
in the <q>Record Fields</q> section.
<ol type="1">
<li><q>difficulty</q> of type <q>text</q>.</li>
<li><q>ingredients</q> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
<li><q>steps</q> of type <q>textarea</q>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete all of the other fields by clicking or tapping on the
trashcan
<img src="./trash3-fill.svg" height="32" width="32" alt="trash"/>
icon.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search by an ingredient, set the <q>Search Record Field Values</q>
preference to true by clicking or tapping on it and then saving it.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>This is another somewhat of contrived example because you could
easily keep all of your book reviews with your other personal account
data but it might be useful if you want to keep them separated.</p>
<p>For my book reviews, I enter the book title as the record title and
added the following fields using the methodology described in the
recipes section above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that only add records or books that have been read.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>name</th>
<th>type</th>

<h2 id="developer-notes">Developer Notes</h2>
<p>These are things that developers might be interested in.</p>
<p>It was built using pure javascript and relies on the browser secure

to make it work better in mobile browsers.</p>
<p>It is free and open-source (FOSS) software.</p>
<h3 id="release-pam">Release PAM</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the <code>VERSION</code> file using semantic versioning.</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to propagate the new version.</li>
<li>Run <code>make app-help</code> to propagate any changes to
<code>HELP.md</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>make web</code> to create <code>pam-www.tar</code> which
contains the app in <code>pam/www</code>. It can be used to release to a
secure (HTTPS) server. The app cannot be used on a non-secure (HTTP)
server because it requires a secure context.</li>
